OSU is a collection of various unsupported routines used by ObjectStore
Consultants to detect performance issues in ObjectStore applications. These
routines have repeatedly proven useful to customers and Object Design
Consultants over time.  However, the tools  in this directory are not
guaranteed to work, nor will they remain the same  from one release to to the
next. Therefore, you must be cautious about relying on anything in this
directory for production purposes.  Object Design does not provide any level
of support for code provided in this directory.
