Examples of Schema Keys
=======================

These examples illustrate how to use schema keys.  For additional
information about these examples, see "ObjectStore C++ API User
Guide", chapter 7.

Files in this directory are:

    README.TXT    - this file
    doall         - script that runs the whole example
    makefile      - makefile
    create_sk.cpp - setting database schema keys
    set_sk.cpp    - setting application schema keys

To build and run this example, first make sure your environment
variable OS_ROOTDIR is set to the path of your ObjectStore
installation.

Then you can either type 'doall' to run all the steps of this example,
or do each step separately.  When you are done with the example, type
'nmake clean' to clean up.
