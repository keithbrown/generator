Hello World Example
===================
This example is a standard 'hello world' program with
a few modifications to verify your ObjectStore setup.

Files in this directory are:

    README.TXT        - this file

    doall.bat         - batch file which runs the whole example

    makefile          - makefile

    hello.cc          - hello world C++  code

To build and run this example, first make sure that your environment
variable OS_ROOTDIR is set to the path of your ObjectStore installation.

Then you can either

1. Type 'doall' to run all the steps of this example.

or, to do each step of this example separately, do:

1. Type 'nmake' to make the hello executable.

2. Run the hello executable by typing 'hello'.

When you are done with this example, you may type
'nmake clean' to clean up.
