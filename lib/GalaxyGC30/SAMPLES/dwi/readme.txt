DWI -- Domains With dialogItems
-------------------------------
This module implements a subclass of vdomainview that manages dialog
items.  You can put dialog items into the domain and let users operate
them as if they were sitting in a dialog or a container.  The users
can scroll the domain around (along with the dialog items).  Included
is a "tryout" mode that you can turn on/off to allow the moving of
the dialog items as domain objects.  There are a couple of "normal"
domain objects in there as well.

Things this module demonstrates:
  -- Subclassing
  -- Use of domains and domainviews
  -- Use of domain observers
  -- Handling a dialog item list and associated owner functions.
  -- Use of drag pinning in a domainview
