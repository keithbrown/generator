                      TILING 
             sample Galaxy application

The  tiling  program  (files  tiling.c  tiling.h   tiling.vr
grid.c) draws quasi periodical Penrose tiling of the  plane.
You can select different dimension  of the tiling from 3  to
13 from  the Options  menu.   You can  also select different
size of tiling elements.

It illustrates Drawing, Command, Dialog, Color and  Resource
managers. 

This  sample  gives  an  example   how  to  write  a  Galaxy
application starting  from the  similar application  written
using Microsoft Windows SDK. It may be useful as a  starting
point  for  developers  already   familiar  with  MSW   SDK.
Tilingw  (files  tilingw.c  gridw.c  tilingw.h  tilingw.ico,
tilingw.rc ) - application  with the same functionality  and
user  interface  but  written  by  SDK  is  included  (  for
MS-Windows  platforms).
