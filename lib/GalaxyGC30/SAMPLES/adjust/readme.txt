Managers Illustrated: Spring and Spring Domain Manager

This program illustrates how to create a dialog-specific adjuster item.
The code has knowledge of the dialog's layout so it is not an example
of a generic splitter/adjuster dialog item.  It does however, give the
programmer a sense of what is involved in doing runtime adjustments to
a dialog's item layout.  Particularly, it demonstrates how the Spring
and Spring Domain Managers must be used in adjustments.

Adjust also demonstrates how to save a dialog's window bounds across
sessions using the Galaxy Resource Manager.

To exit the demo select the "Quit" menu item or close the dialog
through the window manager.
