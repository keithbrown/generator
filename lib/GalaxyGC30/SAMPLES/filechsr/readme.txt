This directory contains three demos showing the use of the file chooser:

	filechs1     Shows setup and use of standard, no-frills
		     file chooser.

	filechs2     Shows setup and use of subclassed file chooser,
		     to filter on file types (in this case, C source
		     files .c and .h)

	filechs3      Shows setup and use of subclassed file chooser,
		      to filter on file types (in this case, C source
		      files .c and .h) with the addition of a menu
		      on the file chooser menubar to selectively turn
		      on/off file filtering.
