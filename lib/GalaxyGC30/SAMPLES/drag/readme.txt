
Drag Sample
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The drag program consists of a "Drag" dialog and a "Drop"
dialog. The Drag dialog contains a scrolling list and an
image. The list entries as well as the image can be dragged
individually from the Drag dialog to the Drop dialog using
the drag mouse button combination specific to the
particular look-and-feel in use. The program illustrates
use of the Galaxy Drag Manager.
