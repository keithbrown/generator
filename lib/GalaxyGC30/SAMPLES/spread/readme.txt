spread -- Spreadsheet sample
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This sample demonstrates a simple spreadsheet built with Galaxy.  It uses 
the List Manager extensively and also makes use of the Text, Command, Class,
Drawing, and other managers.  Operations on cells and ranges is supported,
and in-cell editing is implemented.  Subclassing is used to create custom
listviews, and the drawing manager is used to create an Excel-inspired UI.

A number of commands are available in the menus, most of which have popup
dialogs.  There are no import or export routines implemented, although 
these could be easily added.  With a bit of work, the chart demo included
in the Galaxy distribution could be incorporated into this sample.  Note
that there are no plans to do this, nor are there any plans to enhance
this sample in any way.  The reader/user, however, is free to do what they
wish with it.
