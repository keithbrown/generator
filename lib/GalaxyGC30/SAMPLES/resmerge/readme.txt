 * Description Of resmerge sample:
 *     This code illustrates how to merge multiple resource files into a 
 *     destination resource file.  The destination resource file is the last
 *     resource file in the command line.  If the destination resource file
 *     does not exist, it is created.  Use the option -replace if you want
 *     to replace existing resources in the destination resource file.
 *
 * NOTE:  If the destination resource file exists and an error occurs during
 *        the merge, the destination resource file can become corrupted.
