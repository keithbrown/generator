This sample program consists of a dialog containing a domain view whose
domain objects form a line graph. The lines or points can be dragged 
one at a time to change the graph. The lines will live update as the 
drag occurs.

This sample needs no command line options to run correctly.

This sample adds no more command line options (nothing more than the
   usual command line options Galaxy applications understand).

To quit, press the "Quit" button.
