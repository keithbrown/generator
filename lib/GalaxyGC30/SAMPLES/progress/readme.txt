
progress -- Progress Sample
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This sample demonstrates a method for doing work while updating a progress
indicator.  Each "process" is represented by a dialog with a slider which
is updated at regular intervals.  The work being done in this sample is not
meaningful, but the concepts demonstrated could be adapted for use in an
application which needs these features.

To use the program, run the progress executable and press the New button
to create a new progress dialog.  Each dialog will have a number in the
title bar indicating its relative starting position.  When the indicator
reaches the end of the bar, the dialog will automatically close itself.
Multiple progress dialogs can be opened, simulating multiple processes.
