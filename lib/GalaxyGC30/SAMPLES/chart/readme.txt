/* Description Of 'chartdmo' sample:
 *	This sample is composed of a sample charting packacge with a demo
 *	that exercises it.  Charts in the demo include a line chart,
 *	scatter chart, line chart with 4 lines, and double-Y chart.
 *
 *	There are two axuilarry dialogs the user can play with that
 *	affect what subset of the data is being graphed, as well as control
 *	different graph attributes, such as color, line dash, etc.
 *
 *	To run, run "chartdmo".  It adds no new command-line switches
 *	outside of the usual Galaxy ones.  To quit it, close any window
 *	from your window manager.
 *
 *	Spiffy features to try: click on the squares of color to bring up
 *	a color chooser.  When in a scrolling mode, try grabbing-hand
 *	scrolling.
 *
 * Disclaimer:
 *	The chart code is about 1/2 finished, and probably never will be
 *	completed by Visix.  You are free to use it and extend it however
 *	you like.  I beleive that the architecture is very good; however
 *	the skeletal parts haven't been fleshed in.
 *
 *	The API to this charting sample in no way implies that any future
 *	Visix charting packages will use a similar API or architecture.
