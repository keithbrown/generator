
regexp
------

This program can be used to test simple regular expressions directly.

This demo consists of a single dialog.  It has a pattern field to enter
the regular expression and a target field to enter the string that gets
searched.  The result and the value of any tagged segments are placed
in output text fields.  There are also toggle items to set whether the
search is case sensitive or proceeds from the end of the target string.
