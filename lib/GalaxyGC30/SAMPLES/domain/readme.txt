                                vdomain

This sample program consists of a dialog containing a domain item and many
controls with which to manipulate the attributes of the domain item. You 
can add a specific number of colored rectangles to the domain and then
experiment with the different attributes of the domain item. The sample
demonstrates the many features of a vdomainitem that you get "for free".
The only code that was required to make this sample is the code to actually
draw the domain objects and the code to draw a selection indication for 
the objects. You can choose to have colored rectangles be your domain objects
(the default), or images, or text.


This sample needs no command line options to run correctly.

This sample adds no more command line options (nothing more than the
   usual command line options Galaxy applications understand).

To place a specific number of colored rectangles into the domain, enter 
   the number in the "# Objects:" text field and hit <return>.

To quit, press the "Close" button.
