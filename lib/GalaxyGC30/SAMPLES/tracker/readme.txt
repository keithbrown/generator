Tracker demo program
------- ---- -------

This program demonstrates one way to do some simple animation
using domains and the Galaxy timer mechanism.  It accomplishes
the animation by creating domain objects which are drawn as images.
The positions of these images change on a regular basis, as per the
timer callback interval.  It also shows some subclassing possibilities
for domains, in particular, how to customize drawing of the domain
background.
