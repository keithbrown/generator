# This is the file that provides the mappings between application
# contexts and URLs.

# The format is that any line not starting with a "#" contains
# first a context, then a URL.
# Contexts containing spaces must be either escaped or quoted.
# Everything after context and up to the newline is considered 
# part of the URL (except for the white space between the 
# context and URL).  This means that URLs can (and may) contain 
# spaces. 

# Context for the button that opens the confirm.
"Open Confirm"			buttons.html#OpenConfirm


# Contexts for some functions available on both the toolbar and
# the menubar.  
# Note that we use non-specific contexts for this.
# if we wanted too, we could specify more specific context which
# contained more information about the location of these functions
# in the interface.  This might be handy if the documentation
# contains images of the interface or somesuch.
# For example, we could use the following context:
#	DialogMenuBarItemFileMenuSave
# to specify exactly the Save menuitem in exactly this dialog.
# See the documentation on vhelphtmllocator for additional information
# on how contexts work.
# 
# NB: we escaped the space in "Save As" with a backslash instead
# of using quotes like we did above.

# Here's a non-relative URL.  Cool!

# Context for the main dialog.
Dialog					dialog.html

# Context for the confirm dialog.
# Note that we use a very specific context here.  It is the string
# you get when you append the leader "Dialog" to the follower
# "ConfirmDialog".
