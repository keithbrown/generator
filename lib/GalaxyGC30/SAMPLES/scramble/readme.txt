
Illustrates a screen-saver like application that does animation.  The 
screen is divided into cells. The cells move around to scramble the
screen, similar to the grid-type puzzles where one must slide individual
squares around until the form a picture.

The sample demonstrates how to access the contents of the 'root' window
of a platform's windowing system, how to setup recurrent timers, and how
to move blocks of raster data to different locations on the screen.  It
also makes use of the rand() random number generator as the means for
choosing which portion of the screen to move.
