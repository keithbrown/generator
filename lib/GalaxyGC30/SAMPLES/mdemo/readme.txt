vmdemo Sample
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The vmdemo program illustrates an "outline view." This is
a list where each row can expand and collapse to
show/hide sub-rows. It is very similar to the vre dictionary
editor. The vmdemo program also illustrates how to use
two list views as column and row headers for a third list
view. When the main list view is scrolled, its column and
row headers scroll with it.
