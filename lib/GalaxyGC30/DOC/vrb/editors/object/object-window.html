Use the Object Editor to browse, create, delete, and edit the objects
in a Galaxy resource (<tt>.vr</tt>) file. Objects can be edited by
changing their properties. Additionally, you can invoke various
graphical resource editors to edit many Galaxy objects. <p>

<h2>Object Editor Map</h2>

<center>
<img src="object-window.gif">
</center>
<P>

The Object Editor consists of the following: <p>

<ul>
  <li><B><a href = "#palette">Object Notebook</a></B>
      <BR>
      Contains prototype objects that you can drag to various editors
      and windows in the Visual Resource Builder. Each page of the Object Notebook
      contains a palette of icons representing various objects. Help
      is available for each of the <a href
      ="../../palettes/index.html">Object Palettes</a>. 
      <P>
      
  <li><B>Application Objects List</B>
      <BR>
      Contains a list of objects, and their contained objects and children.
      <P>
      
  <li><B>Property List</B>
      <BR>
      Displays the editable properties of the currently selected
      object.
      <P>
       
  <li><B>Editor Area</B>
      <BR>
      Displays a graphical editor for the currently selected object
      (if an editor for that object is available).
</ul>

The Object Notebook is a <a href =
"../../../concepts/dockers.html">docker</a>. You can drag it off into
a floating window, but you cannot hide it.  The other three panels are
separated by splitters. Each panel may be hidden by dragging a
splitter over it. You can also use options available from the Windows
menu to hide or show panels.<p>
	  

<hr>

<a name="palette"></a>

<h2>Object Notebook</h2>

The Object Notebook displays icons for all available object
types. Objects are sorted by class into several notebook 
pages. These include both "fundamental" object types, plus objects
that have been exported.<p>

To export an object you have created, select the item and select
<b>Export to Palette</b> from the <b>Object</b> menu. An icon for your
object will appear as the last item on the palette. 
<P>

Each object in the Object Notebook represents both a class and a resource to
load the object from. The <a href =
"../../palettes/resources/index.html">Resource</a> page
contains fundamental resource types. <p>


<h3>OLE Objects </h3>

On platforms that support OLE, a page in the Object Notebook shows the
OLE types available on the system and provides for creation of OLE control 
sites.  When an OLE control site is created, the <a href =
"../../../reference/vole-x.html">OLE subclass</a> 
for the type will be automatically
generated in the current project (if it does not already exist).<p>


<h2>Application Objects List</h2>

The Application Objects List displays the objects and non-loadable
resources which are stored in the file. Use the Application Objects
List to select an object to be edited. <p>

<center>
<IMG SRC="app-object-list.gif">
</center>
<P>

Each entry in the Object List contains an icon indicating the
type or class of the object or resource. It also displays the Resource
Tag of the object.
<P>

The Resource Tag is an editable field that identifies the resource
storage for the object.  The Resource Tag is used to load an object. 
The Resource Tag is not the item's Object tag, which is
defined by the Tag property. The Object Tag is used to access
resources that have been loaded and is used by methods such as
<a href = "../../../reference/vobject-x.html#vobjectFindChild">
<B>FindChild</B></a>.
<P>

<h2>Properties List</h2>

The Properties List contains editable properties for an object
selected in the Object List. The Properties List has two columns:

<ul>
  <li><B>Type</B>
      <BR>
      Displays the type of the object. The type can be
      edited for subclasses of the object.
      <P>
      
  <li><B>Value</B>
      <BR>
      Displays the value of the property.  Typically, objects
      have default values that you can edit. Some property values are
      edited inline, while others have editors you can launch from the
      Properties List.<P>

      Selecting an ellipsis button in the Value field launches an
      editor for that property.
</ul>


<hr>

<h2>Adding Objects</h2>

Add an object to the current file by dragging its icon from a palette
in the Object Notebook into one of several destinations. You can drop
the icon into the Application Objects List or into various graphical
resource editors (for example, the <a href =
"../dialog/dialog-editor.html">Dialog Editor</a> or the <a href =
"../menu/menu-editor.html">Menu Editor</a>). You can also use the
<B>Object:New</B> menu option to add objects to the Application
Objects List. <p> 

The location of the object is either determined by the drag
destination, or by the current selection (if a menu item is used).
The tag is the unqualified class name of the object, with a number
appended for uniqueness. Objects can only be created inside of
dictionary or array resources in the browser view.  In particular,
they cannot be created inside imported libraries, or in the palette
array. <p>

<B>Note: </B>Creating an object from a palette in the Object Notebook
creates a copy of the object. When you edit the new object, you do not
affect any other previously created objects. <p>

<h2>Rearranging Objects</h2> 

Objects or resources inside a dictionary or array resource may be
moved from one dictionary or array resource into another, by
dragging with the "move" mouse binding.  Elements in an array can also
be reordered this way. Any object or resource may be copied into a
dictionary or array resource by dragging with the "copy" mouse
binding. <p>
      
Any selected resource or object's resource definition can be copied
into the clipboard by selecting it and choosing the Copy menu item.
This can be pasted into any dictionary or array resource with the
Paste menu item.  In addition, you can Cut or Clear objects and
resources from array or dictionary resources only. <p>
