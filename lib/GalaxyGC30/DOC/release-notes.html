<P><HR><P>

<h2><a name = "changes">Changes from Previous Releases</a></h2>

Galaxy 3 is a major upgrade over Galaxy 2.x. Please read this section
carefully and understand these changes before using Galaxy 3.
<P>
<H3>No more support for Galaxy 1.x format resource files</H3>
<UL>
Galaxy 3.0 no longer contains backward compatibility for resource files before
2.0. These resource files cannot be edited by the Visual Resource Builder or 
used with Galaxy 3.0 applications.  
<P>
<TT>vrescopy</TT> from Galaxy 2.x will convert 1.x resource files to the 
newer format. The version of <TT>vrescopy</TT> included with Galaxy 3.0 
will not read the 1.x format.
<P>
If you need a 1.x version of <TT>vrescopy</TT>, it can be downloaded
from the Visix website.
</UL>

<H3>Changes to vdomainview</H3>
<UL>
The return value from domain view key event handlers is no longer
ignored. Overrides of <CODE>vdomainviewHANDLE_KEY_EVENT</CODE> in a subclass of
vdomainviewClass, or of <CODE>vdomainviewKEY_EVENT</CODE> in a
vdomainviewEventClass subclass must now return <CODE>vTRUE</CODE> if the key event
is to be considered handled by the domain view, or <CODE>vFALSE</CODE> if the key
is to be eligible for processing by other items in the domain view's
dialog.
<P>
</UL>

<H3>Changes to vtextitem</H3>
<UL>
In Galaxy 3.0, <CODE>sizeof(vtextitemText)</CODE> is not equal to
<CODE>sizeof(vtext)</CODE>, as it was in Galaxy 2.x.
<CODE>vtextitemText</CODE> is the type for the instances of the text subclass
used within textitems.  This subclass provides some useful
linkage between attributes of the UI hierarchy of the textitem
and the text data object.  
<P>
In Galaxy 2.x, the Galaxy C samples <CODE>password</CODE> 
and <CODE>textfilter</CODE>
were erroneously using "<CODE><B>vtext</B></CODE>" instead of 
"<CODE><B>vtextitemText</B></CODE>" for derived
types based off the <CODE>vtextitemText</CODE> subclass.  The sample code has been 
fixed for Galaxy 3.0, and any customer code that was copied from it 
should be fixed accordingly.
<P>
</UL>

<H3>Changes to vbutton</H3>
<UL>
<H4>vbutton is now a vcontrol</H4>

Previous releases of Galaxy treated a button as an inherently
stateless dialog item.  This proved inconvenient for implementing
toggles that have the same appearance as buttons. To resolve this
dilemma, vbutton has been reparented to vcontrol.  A vbutton with a
max value of 1 and min value of 0 will now act as a toggle.  A button
whose max and min values are both 0 will act as a classic vbutton.
Non-toggling buttons are created by default.

<H4>LAF specific disabled images</H4>

New in Galaxy 3 are algorithmically generated disabled images on buttons.
In previous releases, the image on a disabled vbutton would not change 
its appearance.  Now with Galaxy 3 look-and-feel specific disabled
images are automatically generated on the fly from any image set on
the button.  

<H4>New drawing methods</H4>

In addition to the new dialog item drawing methods which can be
overridden to customize specific parts of the appearance of an item,
vbuttons also has a new method.  It is <PRE>
    vbuttonDRAW_MENU_FROB_WITH
//c++   vbutton::DrawMenuFrobWith  
</PRE>
and is used to draw the LAF-specific menu indicator on a button.
<P>
The method vbuttonDRAW_CONTENT has been deprecated in favor of the new 
dialog item level method vdialogDRAW_ITEM_CONTENT_WITH.
<P>
The vbutton versions of methods which were duplicated in vcontrol and
vbutton are now deprecated.  They are:  
<UL>
     <TT>vbuttonHILITE</TT>   -- use vcontrolHILITE<BR>
     <TT>vbuttonUNHILITE</TT> --  use vcontrolUNHILITE
</UL>
<P>
</UL>

<H3>Multiple Threading</H3>
<UL>
Galaxy is now threadsafe and supports threads on all thread-capable platforms.
 Refer to the <A HREF="prog-guide/Thread.html">Thread</A>, 
<A HREF="prog-guide/Mutex.html">Mutex</A>, and 
<A HREF="prog-guide/Condition.html">Condition</A> chapters of 
the <A HREF="prog-guide/index.html">Programmer's Guide</A>
for more information.
</UL>

<H3>ActiveX Integration</H3>
<UL>
With Galaxy 3.0, applications running on a Windows platform can now take advantage of 
many features offered by Microsoft's distributed object technology. A
new kind of Galaxy dialog item which will enable the inclusion of ActiveX components 
within Galaxy dialogs is introduced. This dialog item, the
<B><CODE>voleControlSite</CODE></B>, acts as an ActiveX control container. 
Through a new Visual Resource Builders editor, users 
can embed ActiveX controls in a Galaxy dialog, set properties using the
standard OLE Property Pages, and indicate control events which should generate 
notification. In addition, for any control, a separate code generation utility
builds a complete set of C stub functions or C++ class definitions which extend the 
base control site class and allow easy invocation of the control's methods plus
receiving of control events. 
<P>
The Galaxy Clipboard Manager has been enhanced to make use of the OLE clipboard 
protocol in order to take advantage of the rich data typing provided by OLE.
The changes to the Clipboard Manager will enhance clipboard functionality, which 
currently only allows cut and paste of text. The Clipboard Manager includes
built-in support for transfer of bitmaps, plus the extensibility to handle other types of 
data through additional Galaxy API. 
<P>
Refer to the <A HREF="prog-guide/ActiveX.html">ActiveX</A>
and <A HREF="prog-guide/Clipboard.html">Clipboard</A>
chapters of the <A HREF="prog-guide/index.html">Programmer's Guide</A>
for more information.
</UL>

<H3>Forms and Fields</H3>
<UL>
Form-centric database and non-database applications are now easier to
build. Refer to the 
<A HREF="prog-guide/FormItem.html">FormItem</A> chapter of 
the <A HREF="prog-guide/index.html">Programmer's Guide</A>
for more information.
</UL>

<H3>Help System</H3>
<UL>
The Galaxy help system has been substantially rewritten. Help now
supports HTML documents and display on third-party web browsers, 
among other improvements.
Refer to the <A HREF="prog-guide/Help.html">Help</A>, 
<A HREF="prog-guide/URL.html">URL</A>, and 
<A HREF="prog-guide/Webbrowse.html">Webbrowse</A> chapters of 
the <A HREF="prog-guide/index.html">Programmer's Guide</A>
for more information.
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="ui_components">New UI Components</A></H3>
<UL>
Toolbars, tooltips, treeviews, dockers, and status bars
are available on all platforms. Refer to the 
<A HREF="prog-guide/Docker.html">Docker</A>, 
<A HREF="prog-guide/Toolbar.html">Toolbar</A>,
<A HREF="prog-guide/Tree.html">Tree</A>,  
<A HREF="prog-guide/Tree_List.html">Tree List</A>, and 
<A HREF="prog-guide/Status_Bar.html">Status Bar</A> chapters of 
the <A HREF="prog-guide/index.html">Programmer's Guide</A>
for more information.
</UL>

<H3>Data Formats</H3>
<UL>
Galaxy 3 provides sophisticated formatting for numbers, strings, and 
dates. It does this by interpreting arbitrary input strings as type-specific values.
 This is accomplished by allowing an arbitrary number of patterns to be 
introduced. Each pattern represents one possible form of the textual input. One such
pattern is considered the output pattern and is used to create a string form of a 
typed value. A Format can be used for validation in that an attempt to parse an input
string will fail if the string does not match any of the set of patterns that a Format 
holds. There are Format subclasses for each of the most common data types
supported by modern relational databases: date/time, long integer, unsigned 
integer, double, and boolean. 
Refer to the <A HREF="prog-guide/Format.html">Format</A> chapter of 
the <A HREF="prog-guide/index.html">Programmer's Guide</A>
for more information.
</UL>

<H3>Input Focus Control</H3>
<UL>
Galaxy 3 breaks the link between input focus and the activation state of a dialog. 
When a dialog becomes inactive, input focus is not automatically removed from
the focused item. Dialog items also have the ability to conditionally accept focusing 
and unfocusing operations. An item can refuse to give up input focus until its
contents are valid. A suite of new methods has been introduced allowing 
programmatic denial of focus change. 
</UL>

<H3>Generalized Observers</H3>
<UL>
The previous version of Galaxy had specialized observer objects for text,
domains, and lists. Galaxy 3 generalizes the observer mechanism so that
any object can be observed and can itself be an observer. The
implementation of each object determines the observable actions. An
observable action generates an ANNOUNCE message within the object,
and an OBSERVE message to each observer. 
</UL>

<H3>Communications Enhancements</H3>
<UL>
Galaxy 3 introduces a new Communications API to replace the old
vcommChannel/vcommAddress abstraction. The old vcomm API is still
available but has not been modified for thread safety and has been
completely deprecated. The new Communications API presents
communications as operations on vclass objects rather than abstract
drivers, making it easier modify existing classes and add new classes. 
<P>
The new architecture supports both stream and datagram communication
abstractions, without inhibiting either. Locations can now be specified
using standard Universal Resource Locator (URL) syntax.
Communications objects can now be used in both asynchronous and fully
synchronous modes. Sending and receiving data can occur from multiple
concurrent threads without application-level locking. The new
communications manager makes extensive use of attributes, which can be
modified and extended to fit specific application needs. 
<P>
TCP, UDP, and shared memory transports are supported on all platforms
except VMS under the new communications API. Many other
platform-specific classes are also included: <BR>
<UL>
UNIX pipes <BR>
OS/2 named pipes <BR> 
Macintosh OpenTransport <BR> 
</UL>
<P>
Refer to the <A HREF="prog-guide/Communication.html">Communication</A> chapter of 
the <A HREF="prog-guide/index.html">Programmer's Guide</A>
for more information.
</UL>

<H3>Clipboard Enhancements</H3>
<UL>
Galaxy's Clipboard class has been rewritten to improve performance and include
better support for ActiveX.
Refer to the <A HREF="prog-guide/Clipboard.html">Clipboard</A> chapter of 
the <A HREF="prog-guide/index.html">Programmer's Guide</A>
for more information.
</UL>

<H3>Drawing Enhancements</H3>
<UL>
In Galaxy 3 an object oriented drawing API has been added to the
existing drawing API. The original, stack based, API is still
functional and supported, but will be deprecated in a future release. The
principal classes in the new object oriented API are: Drawing Context,
Drawing Path, and Pen. The Drawing Context represents a display device
and provides methods to do basic rendering and coordinate system
manipulation. The Drawing Path is an abstract collection of segments and
subpaths that can be rendered on any Drawing Context. The Pen class
encapsulates color, line width and other rendering attributes. New
methods have been added to Galaxy GUI objects to support the object
oriented drawing API. 
Refer to the <A HREF="prog-guide/Draw.html">Draw</A> chapter of 
the <A HREF="prog-guide/index.html">Programmer's Guide</A>
for more information.
</UL>

<H3>Module</H3>
<UL>
The Module class allows a process to dynamically load an object code
module, search for named symbols within the module, and transfer
control to entry points in the module. 
Refer to the <A HREF="prog-guide/Module.html">Module</A> chapter of 
the <A HREF="prog-guide/index.html">Programmer's Guide</A>
for more information.
</UL>

<H3>Iterator </H3>
<UL>
Iterator allows iterator types to be designed as classed
objects. The main new use of these iterator types is the building of
complete child object iterators for user-interface objects. 
Refer to the <A HREF="prog-guide/Iterator.html">Iterator</A> chapter of 
the <A HREF="prog-guide/index.html">Programmer's Guide</A>
for more information.
</UL>

<H3>Process </H3>
<UL>
The Process class allows Galaxy applications to more efficiently
launch new processes. Refer to the <A HREF="prog-guide/Process.html">
Process</A> chapter of  the <A HREF="prog-guide/index.html">
Programmer's Guide</A> for more information.

</UL>

<H3>Microsoft Windows Enhancements</H3>
<UL>
Galaxy now supports building different types of modules for Windows.
Previously, Galaxy only supported graphical applications; now it is possible to use
Galaxy to build Win32 console applications and dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). 
<P>
Galaxy now uses the native Windows menu bar support instead of drawing menus
with Galaxy-specific code. This opens the door to OLE applications which alter
the menu bar, and also addresses some long-standing problems with menu
traversal into and out of the "system" menu. 
<P>
Any Galaxy Dialog Item can now specify colors and fonts to inherit from the
Windows settings. Previously, the standard Galaxy items and subclasses of them
tracked colors and fonts, but did not allow customization for implementing new
items. Also, the improved system will produce the correct results when using a
Windows look-and-feel on another platform, or a non-Windows look-and-feel on
a Windows platform. These changes allow Galaxy applications to dynamically
change in response to Control Panel changes. 
<P>
Support for the Windows 95 look-and-feel has been added to Galaxy. Support for
new Windows 95 user interface components, including toolbar, tooltips, treeview,
dockers, and status line components has also been added to Galaxy. See the
section '<A HREF="#ui_components">New User Interface Components</A>' for a 
more detailed description of these items. 
</UL>

<H3>Apple Macintosh Enhancements</H3>
<UL>
Support for the Macintosh 3D Gray Scale interface has been added to Galaxy 3.0;
it has been made the default look-and-feel. The older 2D monochrome
look-and-feel is still available as <CODE>-laf mac</CODE>.
<P>
Macintosh Toolbox code is used to draw user interface items where possible. A
special flag will be provided to allow application subclasses to make use of native
drawing. Floating palette windows are supported using the standard floating window style. 
</UL>

<H3>IBM OS/2 Enhancements</H3>
<UL>
Clipboard and printing support has been greatly improved in Galaxy 3 on the
OS/2 ports. 
<P>
Drawing performance has been greatly improved. Galaxy can now take advantage
of hardware accelerated video boards. 
<P>
Display of dithered colors has been improved, buttons are now properly
positioned, and control images are retrieved from the window system instead of
from a Galaxy resource file. 
</UL>

<H3>UNIX Enhancements</H3>
<UL>
The Print Manager will supply default Page Setup and Print Job Confirmation
dialogs for UNIX versions of Galaxy. 
</UL>

<H3>Documentation</H3>
<UL>
Documentation has been improved in the following areas:
<P>
<UL>
  <li>Online help is now HTML-based, and is more comprehensive than previous releases.<P>

  <li>The <a href="tutorial/index.html"> Tutorials</a>, 
  <a href="platform-notes.html"><I>Platform Notes</I></a>, and the
  <a href="release-notes.html"><I>Release Notes</I></a>
      are now available only as online documents. <P>

  <li>The <a href="prog-guide/index.html"><I>
      Programmer's Guide</I></a> is much improved from previous versions, and contains
      additional chapters covering new features of Galaxy 3.0. <P>

  <li>Context-sensitive online help has been expanded and
      updated.<p>
      
 </UL> 
</UL>

<H3>Visual Resource Builder Enhancements</H3>
<UL>
The Visual Resource Builder in Galaxy 3.0 incorporates a new user interface that
simplifies the creating and editing of resources. New resource editors and
functionality have been added to the Visual Resource Builder to accommodate
 new interface items. These new editors include treelist, toolbar, formats, 
database aware items, and Active X. 
<P>
Another new feature of the resource editor in Galaxy 3.0 is dynamic
extensibility. Through the use of the new vmodule manager, the Visual Resource Builder
can recognize and load DLLs or shared libraries at run time. The allows
for new capabilities to be added to the resource editor in the future through
the simple addition of new loadable libraries. 
</UL>

<P><HR><P>

<h2><A NAME="Deprecated">Deprecated Functions</a></H2>

Functions that were deprecated in Galaxy 2.x releases have been removed 
from Galaxy 3. In addition, some functions from Galaxy 2.x have now been 
deprecated. Refer to the <A HREF="deprecated.html">Deprecated Functions</A>
list for more information.

<P><HR><P>

<h2><A NAME="Samples">Galaxy Samples</a></H2>

Many samples are included with this release.
The <a href="../samples/index.html">index file</a> of
the samples directory contains an index of all samples, with links to
each specific sample.
<P>
The following directories contain reusable classes you can use when
writing your own applications. Compiled versions of theses classes are
in the <tt>lib/classes</tt> directory of your  installation.
<P>

<ul>
  <li>draw
  <li>sys 
  <li>ui  
  <li>util
</ul>

<h2><a name = "bugs">Known Bugs</a></h2>

Please see the <a href = "bugs/index.html">bugs list</a> included with the
release for a list of all known bugs. <p>

<P><HR><P>

<h2><a name="docs">Documentation</a></h2>

The <a href ="tutorials/index.html">Tutorial</a> will help you get started using Galaxy.
      
<h3><a name = "help">Online Help</a></h3>

Online help is provided in HTML files in the <B>doc</B> directory at
the top level of the Galaxy installation. The <a href="index.html">index
file</a> in the top level of the <TT>doc</TT> directory is a good starting point.
<P>
You can browse this documentation using your preferred HTML
browser. Note that the Visual Resource Builder may not work with
beta versions of some web browsers.
<P>
You can also access the online documentation from the Visual Resource 
Builder. There are three ways to do this:
<P>

<UL>
  <LI>Select a menu item from the Help menu.
      <P>

  <LI>Press the F1 button while an item of interest has keyboard
      focus.
      <P>

  <LI>Press Shift-F1 and click on an item of interest.
      
</UL>

<h4>Help Preferences</h4>

You can set a preference that specifies which HTML browser the Visual Resource Builder
will use when you invoke online Help. To do this, select the Preferences menu
item under the Edit menu. In the preferences dialog, select the option
for Help preferences. You can choose from among the following:
<P>

<UL>
  <LI><B>System Default</B>: This is the system default HTML
      browser. On Windows systems, you can specify a default browser
      (usually either Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator).
      <P>

  <LI><B>Netscape</B>: Select this option to use
      Netscape Navigator. Note that the Netscape Navigator executable
      must be on your PATH environment variable or be a registered
      browser in order for the Navigator to start up properly.
      If you specify this option and start
      Netscape before requesting help, the Visual Resource Builder should be 
      able to contact the running executable (if the Visual Resource Builder has trouble
      starting Netscape for some reason).
      <P>

  <LI><B>Internet Explorer</B>: Select this option to use
      Internet Explorer. This option is only available on Windows
      platforms. If you specify this option and start
      Internet Explorer before requesting help, the Visual Resource Builder should be 
      able to contact the running executable.
</UL>
<P>
If online help does not work on Windows NT and Windows 95 platforms,
you may have to first set your system default browser either to Netscape or
Internet Explorer prior to running the Visual Resource Builder. <p>

By default, the Visual Resource Builder will "uniconify" the browser and bring it to the front
when the user requests Help. If this behavior is undesirable, you can
turn it off by clicking on the "Raise Browser When Requesting Help"
toggle in the help preferences. <p>

<H4>Documentation Location</H4>

The default Galaxy installation stores the online documentation in the
<CODE>doc</CODE> directory at the top level of the directory
tree. If you choose to relocate the <CODE>doc</CODE> directory (or leave it on the CD-ROM),
you need to provide the Visual Resource Builder with that new location. Go to the help
preferences and set the new location in the "Documentation Location"
preference field. <p>

The default installation places the doc directory as a sibling to the
<CODE>samples</CODE> directory. If either the <CODE>doc</CODE> 
or <CODE>samples</CODE> directory is moved
after installation, the HTML documentation provided with the samples
may not be accessible from either the Galaxy documentation
or the Visual Resource Builder <B>Help:Code Samples</B> menu option. However, you should still be
able to point your browser to the <tt>samples/index.html</tt> file
to access the samples documentation.
