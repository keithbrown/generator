<DL><DD>
One of the three functions needed to create a new type of
scribe. This function is optional and is used to dispose of
any dynamic data stored in the <SAMP>string</SAMP> and/or
<SAMP>data</SAMP> fields of <SAMP>scribe</SAMP> when it is
destroyed.

<PRE>
        typedef ... <B>vscribeFuncs</B>;
</PRE>

<DL><DD>
Similar to a ``class'' for scribes. It contains all of the
static data that is common to scribes of the same type.
This includes pointers to functions that do the work of the
scribe and data indicating the size of characters written
by the scribe. You need to use this only when you are
creating your own scribe type.
</DD></DL>
<P>
<A NAME="vscribeLengthFunc"><HR><H4>vscribeLengthFunc</H4></A>
<PRE>
        typedef ... <B>vscribeLengthFunc</B>;
</PRE>

<DL><DD>
One of the three functions needed to create a new type of
scribe. This function simply returns how many characters
will be written by the <SAMP><A HREF="vscribe-x.html#vscribeScribbleFunc"><CODE>vscribeScribbleFunc</CODE></A></SAMP>,
taking into account the given <SAMP>destMaxLength</SAMP>.
  <P>
When the scribe is told to write its string without any
maximum bounds, <SAMP>vscribeMAX_LENGTH</SAMP> (a large
number) will be passed for the <SAMP>destMaxLength</SAMP>
parameter. The function can explicitly check for this value
and, if it occurs, omit bounds checking from its scanning
loop (if any) for extra speed.

<PRE>
        typedef ... <B>vscribeScribbleFunc</B>;
</PRE>

<DL><DD>
One of the three functions needed to create a new type of
scribe. This function is responsible for doing the actual
work of the scribe, by writing the appropriate string into
the <SAMP>dest</SAMP> buffer of size
<SAMP>destMaxLength</SAMP>, and returning a pointer past
the last character written. This function should <I>not</I>
write a null-terminating character.
  <P>
When the scribe is told to write its string without any
maximum bounds, <SAMP>vscribeMAX_LENGTH</SAMP> (a large
number) will be passed for the <SAMP>destMaxLength</SAMP>
parameter. The function can explicitly check for this value
and, if it occurs, omit bounds checking from its copying
loop for extra speed.
  <P>
The contents of the string written will depend on the type
of scribe and typically will depend on the
<SAMP>string</SAMP> and/or <SAMP>data</SAMP> fields of the
given <SAMP>scribe</SAMP>.

<DL><DD>
Clears the <SAMP>copy</SAMP> flag of a scribe. This flag
should be set if and only if the string field of the scribe
points to a null-terminated <SAMP><A HREF="vchar-x.html#vchar"><CODE>vchar</CODE></A></SAMP> string that
is identical to the string that will be written out by the
scribe. (That is, the flag is set if the scribe simply
copies the string stored in the string field.)
  <P>
You should not modify this flag except when you are
creating a custom type of scribe. This flag will be set up
appropriately by the <SAMP>Scribe</SAMP> function that
created the scribe.
  <P>
When you want to retrieve the string from a scribe, you can
check this flag if you only want to look at the string (as
opposed to storing it somewhere). If the flag is set, you
can retrieve the contents of the string field (cast to a
<SAMP><A HREF="vchar-x.html#vchar"><CODE>vchar</CODE></A> *</SAMP>), examine it directly, and then
destroy the scribe when you are through. This avoids
unnecessary copying of the string.
  <P>
Note that the <SAMP>copy</SAMP> flag may be set in scribes
that do character set conversions; if it is, it indicates
that the character set being translated to is the same as
the original one. Thus, you can use this flag as a means to
avoid unnecessary copying when exporting strings.

Destroys a <SAMP>vscribe</SAMP>. This is done by calling
the scribe's <SAMP>freeData</SAMP> function (specified in

Static initialization macro for a <SAMP>vscribeFuncs</SAMP>
structure. The <SAMP>vscribeFuncs</SAMP> can then be used
to create custom scribes, via <CODE><A HREF="vscribe-x.html#vscribeCreate"><CODE>vscribeCreate</CODE></A></CODE>. A
<SAMP>vscribeFuncs</SAMP> is somewhat like a ``class'' for
scribes in that one such structure is shared by all scribes
of a particular type.
  <P>
The <SAMP>scribble</SAMP> function is responsible for doing
the actual work of the scribe, by writing the appropriate
string into the specified destination buffer. This function
should <I>not</I> write a null-terminating character. The
<SAMP>scribble</SAMP> function can access the string and/or
data fields of the scribe in determining what string to
write into the destination buffer.
  <P>
The <SAMP>length</SAMP> function should return the number

the scribe can be accessed to determine what string is to
be written.

generic data for the <SAMP><A HREF="vscribe-x.html#vscribeFuncs"><CODE>vscribeFuncs</CODE></A></SAMP> functions.
  <P>
This function will only be useful when you are creating a

Figures out how many characters will be written out by a

any null-terminating character (scribes should not write
null-terminating characters).

structure.
  <P>
Use this function before you call
<CODE><A HREF="vscribe-x.html#vscribeScribble"><CODE>vscribeScribble</CODE></A></CODE> if you need to allocate space

Accesses the string field in a <SAMP>vscribe</SAMP>. The

sort of string pointer. However, this need not be the case.
  <P>
If any of a scribe's flags are set, you may use this
function to get the contents of the string field, since the
scribe's flags give you information about the contents of
the string field. For example, you could use this function
to get a <SAMP><A HREF="vstr-x.html#vstr"><CODE>vstr</CODE></A> *</SAMP> from a scribe which has the
dynamic flag set. If you do, be sure to manually destroy
the scribe with <CODE><A HREF="vscribe-x.html#vscribeDestroy"><CODE>vscribeDestroy</CODE></A></CODE> if applicable.

Otherwise, this function will be useful only when you are

it and includes the rest of the header. Thus, subsequent
attempts to include this header will only get a check to
see if <CODE>vscribeINCLUDED</CODE> is undefined, which
will fail and the rest of the header will be skipped.
  <P>
This can also be used to avoid including this file in the
first place. This will have no effect on correctness (this
header will always make the check), but it can improve
compilation time by avoiding the inclusion of header files
that have already been included and are going to be skipped
anyway. For example:
  <P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>

#ifndef vscribeINCLUDED
#include vscribeHEADER
#endif

</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</DD></DL>
<P>
<A NAME="vscribeMAX_LENGTH"><HR><H4>vscribeMAX_LENGTH</H4></A>
<PRE>
        <B>vscribeMAX_LENGTH</B>
</PRE>

<DL><DD>
Value passed to a scribe's <SAMP><A HREF="vscribe-x.html#vscribeLengthFunc"><CODE>vscribeLengthFunc</CODE></A></SAMP>
and <SAMP><A HREF="vscribe-x.html#vscribeScribbleFunc"><CODE>vscribeScribbleFunc</CODE></A></SAMP> functions for the
<SAMP>destMaxLength</SAMP> parameter when the parameter is
not applicable because there is no maximum length. The
value of this constant will be a very large number. If
desired, the <SAMP><A HREF="vscribe-x.html#vscribeLengthFunc"><CODE>vscribeLengthFunc</CODE></A></SAMP> and
<SAMP><A HREF="vscribe-x.html#vscribeScribbleFunc"><CODE>vscribeScribbleFunc</CODE></A></SAMP> functions can explicitly
check for this value and omit bounds checking from copying
loops (rather than checking against this large number) to
gain extra speed.
</DD></DL>
