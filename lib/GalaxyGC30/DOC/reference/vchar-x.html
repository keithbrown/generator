<DL><DD>
Integral type that represents a single character in the
native character set of the Galaxy application. Although
it is most common in English for <SAMP>vchar</SAMP> to be a
single byte, this should not be assumed in order to
correctly support international character sets. Also, note
that the type is commonly unsigned, so negative values
should not be used. The actual type assigned to
<SAMP>vchar</SAMP> is determined when Galaxy is compiled
for a particular system.

<PRE>
        typedef ... <B>vcharFormatFunction</B>;
</PRE>

<DL><DD>
Describes a character format function, which is used to
process one or more arguments passed to
<CODE><A HREF="vchar-x.html#vcharScribeFormat"><CODE>vcharScribeFormat</CODE></A></CODE>. Such a function is
registered under a specific letter by
<CODE><A HREF="vchar-x.html#vcharRegisterFormatFunction"><CODE>vcharRegisterFormatFunction</CODE></A></CODE>. The function's
implementation should read any expected arguments off of
the argument list <SAMP>args</SAMP>, increment the
<SAMP>formatString</SAMP> pointer past the section of the
format string which describes those arguments, and return a
scribe which represents the string value of the arguments
read.
    <P>
<SAMP>flags</SAMP> and <SAMP>precision</SAMP> specify the
modifiers and precision which the caller specified by the
<SAMP>printf</SAMP> syntax. <SAMP>flags</SAMP> can be any
expression created by ORing any of the following constants:

<ul>
<li><SAMP>vcharFORMAT_SIGN_PREFIX</SAMP>
<li><SAMP>vcharFORMAT_BLANK_PREFIX</SAMP>
<li><SAMP>vcharFORMAT_ALTERNATE_FORM</SAMP,
<li><SAMP>vcharFORMAT_LONG</SAMP>. 
</ul>

Precision will be a positive
number if a <SAMP>precision</SAMP> was specified, otherwise
it will be <SAMP>-1</SAMP>. The format function is
responsible for interpreting the <SAMP>precision</SAMP> and
<SAMP>flags</SAMP> in a way which is consistent with the
behavior of other character format functions.
    <P>
<SAMP>formatString</SAMP> is the address of a pointer into
the string buffer. This pointer will initially point to the
letter which invoked the format function, and should be
incremented to skip that letter, plus any other relevant
information which might be extracted from the format string
by the format function. <SAMP>stringLength</SAMP> is the
length of the remaining format string. <SAMP>args</SAMP> is
the address of the <SAMP>va_arg</SAMP> pointer which
indicates the unused arguments the user passed to
<CODE>vcharScribeFormat</CODE>. 
<P>
The ANSI <SAMP>va_arg()</SAMP> macro should be used to extract the
arguments relative to the format function and increment the
argument pointer.
<P>
A sample <CODE>vcharFormatFunction</CODE> is presented
under the entry for <CODE>vcharRegisterFormatFunction</CODE>.

Copies the null-terminated string <SAMP>appendString</SAMP>
into <SAMP>buffer</SAMP>, starting at the end of the
null-terminated string already contained in
<SAMP>buffer</SAMP>. The resulting string contained in
<SAMP>buffer</SAMP> will be null-terminated. It returns a
pointer to the null-terminating character at the end of the
resulting string in <SAMP>buffer</SAMP>. Note that this
routine must traverse <SAMP>buffer</SAMP> to find its end
before appending <SAMP>appendString</SAMP>. This routine is
not guaranteed to produce correct results if
<SAMP>appendString</SAMP> overlaps <SAMP>buffer</SAMP>.

Note that the argument order is reversed from the arguments
in <CODE><A HREF="vchar-x.html#vcharCopy"><CODE>vcharCopy</CODE></A></CODE>; the first parameter is the

from. This reversal makes the argument order the same as
the order in which the strings will appear in the resulting
buffer. Thus, the following sequence would yield the
contents of <SAMP>firstString</SAMP> followed by the
contents of <SAMP>secondString</SAMP> and

<P>
This sequence of calls is less efficient than the
example under <CODE><A HREF="vchar-x.html#vcharCopy"><CODE>vcharCopy</CODE></A></CODE>, because each call to
<CODE>vcharAppend</CODE> must start at the beginning of
<SAMP>buffer</SAMP> rather than at the end of the last
string written. Thus, the first part of <SAMP>buffer</SAMP>

Copies the null-terminated <SAMP>appendString</SAMP> into

This routine will form a string of at most
<SAMP>maxLength</SAMP> characters (including the original
contents) in <SAMP>buffer</SAMP>. Any characters past that
value (including the null-terminating character) will be
ignored. Thus, if the resulting string is too long to fit
(or just exactly the size of the buffer),
<SAMP>buffer</SAMP> will not contain a null-terminating
character, and the returned pointer will point just past
the end of <SAMP>buffer</SAMP> (to <SAMP>buffer</SAMP> +
<SAMP>maxLength</SAMP>). You should write a null character
yourself to the last character in the buffer if you require
a null-terminated string.

<DL><DD>
Returns a pointer to the first token in the null-terminated
string <SAMP>string</SAMP> that consists of characters not
appearing in the null-terminated string
<SAMP>separators</SAMP>. <SAMP>string</SAMP> is modified so
this token will be a null-terminated string. This is done
by writing a null character over the separator character
that ends the token. A null pointer is returned if all of
the characters in <SAMP>string</SAMP> appear in
<SAMP>separators</SAMP>.
<P>
If <SAMP>separators</SAMP> is a zero length string, or no
characters in <SAMP>string</SAMP> appear in
<SAMP>separators</SAMP>, the entire string will be seen as
a single token, and <SAMP>string</SAMP> will simply be
returned unmodified.
<P>
The function also remembers the location of the end of the
first token in <SAMP>string</SAMP> so that future calls to
<CODE><A HREF="vchar-x.html#vcharGetNextToken"><CODE>vcharGetNextToken</CODE></A></CODE> (see below) will return
subsequent tokens in the string.
<P>
<SAMP>string</SAMP> is not copied in any way by
this function and should not be destroyed or overwritten by
the caller if subsequent calls to <CODE><A HREF="vchar-x.html#vcharGetNextToken"><CODE>vcharGetNextToken</CODE></A></CODE> 
are planned. Note that this function has global state, 
so you can only tokenize one string at a time. For example, 
if <SAMP>string</SAMP> were ``Hello, how are
you?'', and <SAMP>separators</SAMP> was
``<SAMP>~,?</SAMP>'' (a string containing the space
character, a comma, and a question mark),
<CODE>vcharGetFirstToken</CODE> would overwrite the comma
with a null character and return a pointer to the capital

<DL><DD>
Should be called only after a call to
<CODE><A HREF="vchar-x.html#vcharGetFirstToken"><CODE>vcharGetFirstToken</CODE></A></CODE>. It returns a pointer to
the next token in the string that consists of characters
not appearing in the null-terminated
<SAMP>separators</SAMP> string. The string is again
modified to make this token null-terminated. Again, the end
of the returned token is remembered so that subsequent
calls to <CODE>vcharGetNextToken</CODE> will return
subsequent tokens in the string. Returns a null pointer if
no more tokens occur in the string. Note that this function
does <I>not</I> restore the previous characters that were
overwritten by nulls.
    <P>
If <SAMP>separators</SAMP> is a zero length string, or no
more characters in the string appear in
<SAMP>separators</SAMP>, the entire remaining portion of
the string will be seen as a single token, and a pointer to
the rest of the string will simply be returned unmodified.
    <P>
Subsequent calls to <CODE>vcharGetNextToken</CODE> will
return subsequent tokens in the string, unless a null
pointer was previously returned, in which case a null
pointer will again be returned.
    <P>
Note that <SAMP>separators</SAMP> need not be the same as
it was with <CODE><A HREF="vchar-x.html#vcharGetFirstToken"><CODE>vcharGetFirstToken</CODE></A></CODE> or for
subsequent calls to <CODE>vcharGetNextToken</CODE>.
    <P>
In the example given under <CODE><A HREF="vchar-x.html#vcharGetFirstToken"><CODE>vcharGetFirstToken</CODE></A></CODE>,
subsequent calls to <SAMP>vcharNextToken</SAMP> with the
same <SAMP>separators</SAMP> string would yield the strings
``how'', ``are'', ``you'', and a null pointer.

Returns a scribe that writes the specified string. This
routine takes a null-terminated string.
    <P>
The created scribe contains no hints about the storage of
the string, so the string will be copied when the scribe is
used. Thus, you should use these entry points when the
string is stored in some temporary place.
    <P>
While this function can be used on any <SAMP>vchar</SAMP>
string, you should be more specific about the nature of the
string if appropriate, in order to minimize unnecessary
copying of the string. If the string is a dynamic string
(<SAMP><A HREF="vstr-x.html#vstr"><CODE>vstr</CODE></A> *</SAMP>), and you do not need it any more, use
<CODE><A HREF="vstr-x.html#vstrScribe"><CODE>vstrScribe</CODE></A></CODE> to pass ownership of the dynamic
string to the scribe rather than using
<CODE>vcharScribe</CODE> and freeing it yourself. If the
string is an entry in the global name table, use
<CODE><A HREF="vname-x.html#vnameScribe"><CODE>vnameScribe</CODE></A></CODE> to avoid possible redundant
interning of the string. If the string is permanently
allocated, use <CODE><A HREF="vchar-x.html#vcharScribeShared"><CODE>vcharScribeShared</CODE></A></CODE> (refer to
page).
    <P>
Whether using these other entry points actually saves work
is dependent on the routine you are passing the scribe to,
but in many cases you will benefit from being as specific
as possible about what kind of string you are scribing.

Next, a minimum field width can be specified by a decimal
digit string. If the argument's string representation has
fewer characters than this number, padding characters will
be added on the left (or right, if the <SAMP>-</SAMP> flag
is specified.) The padding characters will be blanks,
unless the digit string begins with zero, in which case
zeroes will be used. If a <SAMP>*</SAMP> character is
specified for the field width, the field width is
determined by the value of the next argument on the
argument list (with type <SAMP>int</SAMP>).
    <P>
Then, a precision can be specified by a period character
followed by a decimal string. An empty digit string is
treated as zero. Again, the <SAMP>*</SAMP> character can be
used to specify the precision by an argument of type
<SAMP>int</SAMP>. The exact effect of specifying a
precision varies according to argument type.
    <P>
As a final modifier, an l (ell) character can be included
to indicate that the argument is of ``long type.'' Again,
the exact meaning of this is determined by the argument
type.
    <P>
After modifiers (if any), the letter which determines the
argument type must appear. By default, the string manager
understands the following letters as argument types.

ANSI Compatibility Notes:
    <P>
<CODE>vcharScribeFormat</CODE> recognizes the following
argument types which are not ANSI standard:
    <P>
<SAMP>S</SAMP> = <SAMP><A HREF="vscribe-x.html#vscribe"><CODE>vscribe</CODE></A> *</SAMP>, <SAMP>L</SAMP> =
literal string, and <SAMP>b</SAMP> = binary number. In
addition, the <SAMP>s</SAMP> and <SAMP>c</SAMP> argument
types indicate characters in the <SAMP>vchar</SAMP>
character set, rather than plain ASCII <SAMP>char</SAMP>s.
    <P>
Also, the following minor incompatibilities exist with ANSI
<SAMP>printf</SAMP>: the case of the <SAMP>x</SAMP> does
not determine the case of the hex digits; the
<SAMP>+</SAMP> and blank flags do not affect the number
representation by adding a leading plus or space before a
positive number; and the case of the <SAMP>e</SAMP> or
<SAMP>g</SAMP> does not determine the case of the exponent
character.

instances of <SAMP>match</SAMP> in <SAMP>string</SAMP>,
working from left to right. Replaced text is not scanned
for further matches. The strings should be null-terminated.
    <P>
The <SAMP>match</SAMP> string should not be an empty string
(it should be at least one character long); however, the
<SAMP>replace</SAMP> string can be empty if desired. It
generates a <CODE><A HREF="vex-x.html#vexArgRangeException"><CODE>vexArgRangeException</CODE></A></CODE> exception if
the match string is an empty string.
    <P>
These functions can be used in combination with various
string copying functions to do replace operations on
strings. The following example will fill the buffer
<SAMP>newText</SAMP> with the replaced version of
<SAMP>text</SAMP>.

Note that in both of the above examples, intermediate
storage had to be used to hold the result of the replace
operation. If we had tried to copy/replace the string on

valid if you can guarantee that the match string and the
replace string are the same length.)

<DL><DD>
Returns a scribe that writes the specified string. This
routine takes a string (possibly containing null
characters) and an explicit length.
    <P>
The created scribe contains no hints about the storage of
the string, so the string will be copied when the scribe is
used. Thus, you should use these entry points when the
string is stored in some temporary place.
    <P>
While these functions can be used on any <SAMP>vchar</SAMP>
string, you should be more specific about the nature of the
string if appropriate, in order to minimize unnecessary
copying of the string. If the string is a dynamic string
(<SAMP><A HREF="vstr-x.html#vstr"><CODE>vstr</CODE></A> *</SAMP>), and you do not need it any more, use
<CODE><A HREF="vstr-x.html#vstrScribe"><CODE>vstrScribe</CODE></A></CODE> to pass ownership of the dynamic
string to the scribe rather than using
<CODE><A HREF="vchar-x.html#vcharScribe"><CODE>vcharScribe</CODE></A></CODE> and freeing it yourself. If the
string is an entry in the global name table, use
<CODE><A HREF="vname-x.html#vnameScribe"><CODE>vnameScribe</CODE></A></CODE> to avoid possible redundant
interning of the string. If the string is permanently
allocated, use <CODE><A HREF="vchar-x.html#vcharScribeShared"><CODE>vcharScribeShared</CODE></A></CODE> (refer to
page).
    <P>
Whether using these other entry points actually saves work
is dependent on the routine you are passing the scribe to,
but in many cases you will benefit from being as specific
as possible about what kind of string you are scribing.

The Shared variation of
<CODE>vcharSizedScribeWindows</CODE> should be used if the
string being scribed is permanently allocated.
    <P>
If the <SAMP>vchar</SAMP> character set is Microsoft
Windows, the scribe will have its <SAMP>copy</SAMP> and
<SAMP>copySized</SAMP> flags set. The <SAMP>share</SAMP>
and <SAMP>shareSized</SAMP> flags of the scribe will be set
as well. These flags may be checked by routines that
retrieve the string from the scribe to avoid unnecessary
copying and allocation of strings.
    <P>
If the flags are set, you can call
<CODE><A HREF="vscribe-x.html#vscribeGetUnscribed"><CODE>vscribeGetUnscribed</CODE></A></CODE> to get a pointer to the
permanently allocated string. You can use this string
directly without making a private copy.

<DL><DD>
Returns the number of characters written out to the buffer
pointed to by <SAMP>buffer</SAMP> when the
<SAMP>character</SAMP> is mapped to upper case. Mapping to
upper case for most characters is done in the way
prescribed in <CODE>vcharToUpperCase</CODE>; however,
characters which map to a string of upper case characters
(for example, German <S-SET> maps to SS) are handled
correctly by this function. This function does not write
<SAMP>vcharNULL</SAMP> past the end of the upper case
string written into the buffer.
    <P>
The following code fragment maps the null-terminated string
pointed to by <SAMP>orig</SAMP> to upper case and writes it
into the buffer pointed to by <SAMP>dest</SAMP>:

The <SAMP>Bounded</SAMP> variation will limit the number of

<DL><DD>
C pre-processor flag used to protect this header against
multiple inclusion. By default, <CODE>vcharINCLUDED</CODE>
is undefined. When this header is included it first checks
to see that <CODE>vcharINCLUDED</CODE> is undefined and
then defines it and includes the rest of the header. Thus,
subsequent attempts to include this header will only get a
check to see if <CODE>vcharINCLUDED</CODE> is undefined,
which will fail and the rest of the header will be skipped.
    <P>
This can also be used to avoid including this file in the
first place. This will have no effect on correctness (this
header will always make the check), but it can improve
compilation time by avoiding the inclusion of header files
that have already been included and are going to be skipped
anyway. For example:
