<PRE>
        typedef ... <B>vbuffer</B>;
</PRE>

<DL><DD>
Denotes a particular representation of a unit of
information. Each buffer belongs to a group that is
composed of buffers that represent the same information.
Each buffer also has a device that determines its
representation, and an owner that determines the source of
its information. Buffers are used by the Image Manager and
the Color Manager to map images and colors to different
devices simultaneously. Most Galaxy users never need to use
this type directly.
</DD></DL>
<P>
<A NAME="vbufferDevice"><HR><H4>vbufferDevice</H4></A>
<PRE>
        typedef ... <B>vbufferDevice</B>;
</PRE>

<DL><DD>
Denotes the particular representation that information in
a buffer can be translated to. Each buffer object contains
a reference to a particular device that determines how its
information is represented. The window system drivers use
buffer devices to specify the representation of window
system resources.
<P>
Note that a buffer device need not correspond 
to a physical device in any sense. The Pixmap
Library, for example, defines a buffer device for the
source representation of pixmaps. You can create your own
buffer devices using this structure to define new pixmap
and color representations. Buffer devices are usually
declared as static variables and referenced by a pointer to
this type.

        vbuffer * <B>vbufferCreate</B>(

                const vbufferDevice * device,
                const void * owner);
</PRE>

<DL><DD>
Creates a new buffer in the buffer group <SAMP>group</SAMP>
on the device <SAMP>device</SAMP> with the owner
<SAMP>owner</SAMP> and returns a pointer to the new buffer.
If <SAMP>group</SAMP> is <SAMP>NULL</SAMP>, the buffer is
created in its own group. <SAMP>owner</SAMP> can be
<SAMP>NULL</SAMP> at the callers option; it is not used by
the buffer library. Storage for the buffer is allocated by
the buffer library. The buffer library reclaims the storage
occupied by the buffer when it is destroyed with
<CODE><A HREF="vbuffer-x.html#vbufferDestroy"><CODE>vbufferDestroy</CODE></A></CODE>. 
<P>
The new buffer is created with a set of default attributes, 
as documented in the ``Image Manager'' chapter of the 
<I>Galaxy Application Environment Programmer's Guide</I>. 
The buffer must be validated or marked before its contents can be used. 
Note that this function does not check the buffer group for an existing
buffer on the device <SAMP>device</SAMP>. Call <CODE><A HREF="vbuffer-x.html#vbufferFind"><CODE>vbufferFind</CODE></A></CODE> to 
ensure that a new buffer is necessary. This function calls the
<SAMP>Init</SAMP> function of the device once the buffer is
initialized to perform any device-specific initialization.
</DD></DL>

<A NAME="vbufferDestroy"><HR><H4>vbufferDestroy</H4></A>
<PRE>
        void <B>vbufferDestroy</B>(

</PRE>

<DL><DD>
Destroys a given buffer <SAMP>buffer</SAMP>, which must have
been created by the buffer library. Use this function to
reclaim the storage occupied by a buffer. The buffer should
not be referenced by any other object when it is destroyed.
<P>
This function reclaims the storage occupied by
<SAMP>buffer</SAMP> and calls the <SAMP>Destroy</SAMP>
function in the buffers device to reclaim any
device-specific contents. This function automatically
unlinks the buffer from its group, if any. A warning is
printed by debugging libraries if the buffer is locked when
it is destroyed.
</DD></DL>
<P>
<A NAME="vbufferDestroyGroup"><HR><H4>vbufferDestroyGroup</H4></A>
<PRE>
        void <B>vbufferDestroyGroup</B>(

</PRE>

<DL><DD>
Destroys every buffer in the buffer group
<SAMP>group</SAMP>, which must have been created by the
buffer library. Use this function to reclaim the storage
occupied by an entire buffer group when the group's owner is
destroyed. The group should not be referenced by any other
object when it is destroyed. 
<P>
This function reclaims the storage occupied 
by each buffer in the group and calls the
<SAMP>Destroy</SAMP> function in each buffer's device to
reclaim any device-specific contents. This function has the
same effect as <CODE>vbufferDestroy</CODE> on a singleton
group.

</PRE>

<DL><DD>
Searches for a buffer in the buffer group
<SAMP>group</SAMP> on the device <SAMP>device</SAMP> and
returns its pointer. This function returns
<SAMP>NULL</SAMP> if a buffer was not found in the group
for the given device. If group is <SAMP>NULL</SAMP>, this
function returns <SAMP>NULL</SAMP>. A buffer returned by
this function must be validated or marked before its
contents can be used.

<DL><DD>
Returns the <CODE>ClientFlag</CODE> attribute of the

Returns the maximum number of client flags usable by an

<DL><DD>
Returns the next buffer in the buffer group of which
<SAMP>buffer</SAMP> is a part. It returns
<SAMP>buffer</SAMP> if the buffer is a singleton group.
This function can be used to iterate over all the buffers
in a given group. A buffer group is a circular list of
buffers linked by their <CODE>Next</CODE> attributes.

</PRE>

<DL><DD>
Sets the <CODE>Valid</CODE> attribute of the buffer
<SAMP>buffer</SAMP> to <SAMP>FALSE</SAMP>. The buffer is no
longer used to validate invalid buffers, and the buffer is
validated the next time its contents are requested.

<PRE>
        int <B>vbufferIsLocked</B>(

</PRE>

<DL><DD>
Returns <SAMP>TRUE</SAMP> if the buffer <SAMP>buffer</SAMP>
has been locked more times than it has been unlocked,
<SAMP>FALSE</SAMP> if not. A locked buffer is not
garbage-collected by its device.

<PRE>
        int <B>vbufferIsShared</B>(

</PRE>

<DL><DD>
Returns the <CODE>Shared</CODE> attribute of the buffer
<SAMP>buffer</SAMP>. This flag is provided for use by the
device that manages the buffer. It normally indicates that
the contents of the buffer should not be destroyed when the
buffer is destroyed, because they are being shared with
another object. Refer to the device documentation for its
particular meaning, if any.

</PRE>

<DL><DD>
Returns <SAMP>TRUE</SAMP> if the buffer <SAMP>buffer</SAMP>
is valid, <SAMP>FALSE</SAMP> if not. A buffer must be
validated before its contents can be used.

<PRE>
        void <B>vbufferLock</B>(
                vbuffer * buffer);
</PRE>

<DL><DD>
Locks the buffer <SAMP>buffer</SAMP> so that it is not
garbage-collected by its device. Call this function when
you are about to use the contents of a buffer, and call
<CODE><A HREF="vbuffer-x.html#vbufferUnlock"><CODE>vbufferUnlock</CODE></A></CODE> when you are done. 
<P>
Note that a buffer can be locked 
any number of times, and that a buffer
is not considered unlocked until it has been unlocked as
many times as it has been locked. Permanently
locking a buffer may cause the buffers device to run out of
resources.

<PRE>
        void <B>vbufferMark</B>(

</PRE>

<DL><DD>
Indicates to the buffer library that the contents of the
buffer <SAMP>buffer</SAMP> have been changed and that every
other buffer in the same group is now invalid. This
function sets the <CODE>Valid</CODE> attribute of the
buffer <SAMP>buffer</SAMP> to <SAMP>TRUE</SAMP> without
validating it, and invalidates every other buffer in the
same group. Call this function each time you 
change the contents of a buffer.

</PRE>

<DL><DD>
Changes the owning object of the buffer <SAMP>buffer</SAMP>

transfer ownership of a buffer to another object. Note that
if the buffer belongs to a group, every object in the group

Changes the <CODE>Shared</CODE> attribute of the buffer

Unlocks the buffer <SAMP>buffer</SAMP> so that it can be
garbage-collected by its device. Call this function when
you no longer need the contents of a locked buffer. Note

<DL><DD>
Validates the buffer <SAMP>buffer</SAMP> so that the
buffer's contents are derived from any valid buffer in the
buffer's group. This function has no effect if the buffer is
already valid. 
<P>
When a buffer is validated, the buffer
library searches through the buffers group for any buffer
with valid contents. If a valid buffer is found, the
<SAMP>import</SAMP> function of the invalid buffer's device
is called with the invalid buffer and the valid buffer as
arguments (respectively). If the import function returns
<SAMP>FALSE</SAMP>, the <SAMP>export</SAMP> function of the
valid buffers device is called with the valid buffer and
the invalid buffer as respective arguments. 
<P>
This process continues for all valid buffers until an import or
export function returns <SAMP>TRUE,</SAMP> or no valid
buffers are left in the buffer's group. This function then
sets the buffer's <CODE>valid</CODE> attribute to
<SAMP>TRUE</SAMP> and returns.
