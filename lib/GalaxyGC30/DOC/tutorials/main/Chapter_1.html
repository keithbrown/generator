Welcome to the Galaxy Tutorial! This tutorial is designed to help new Galaxy programmers learn to use the Galaxy application development environment to its full potential as quickly as possible. It is also designed for you to start learning at your level. Everyone should read Chapters 1 and 2. After that, the tutorial starts from the simplest possible Galaxy program and gets progressively more involved. We will move from programs which illustrate some basic user interface components to complete applications.<P>
Each chapter begins with a list of the concepts covered in that chapter. These are usually general concepts such as the Dialog Manager or list items. You can use this list to determine if you need to read the chapter, skim it, or skip it altogether. Each chapter also contains one or more programs designed to illustrate the points discussed in the text.<P>
Among other things, you will learn how to:<P>
<UL><LI>build and open dialogs
<LI>use buttons, menus, lists, text, and other graphical user interface (GUI) items
<LI>perform subclassing
</UL><P>
Most chapters in the tutorial present and explain complete Galaxy programs. Each section of the code is identified to the left with a number enclosed in parentheses, as shown in the following example. The blue color is used to indicate logical groupings. The number is used for referencing the example in the text.<P>
<FONT COLOR="0000BB">
<PRE><UL><TT>(1)	/* ANSI headers */
</TT><TT>	#include &lt;vstdlib.h&gt;  /* for exit(), EXIT_SUCCESS*/
</TT></UL></PRE>
</FONT><P>
This lets you match the code with the corresponding explanatory text. Often a chapter builds upon the example used in the previous chapter or shows how to accomplish the same task in a different way. To look at several problems and how they might be solved using Galaxy, we will look at several programs in the tutorial.<P>
<UL><B><I>Note:</I></B> There is often more than one way to solve a problem. Since the purpose is to teach Galaxy 
and not programming in general, the tutorial usually opts for the most straightforward 
algorithm. A more efficient algorithm is often harder to understand and gets in the way of 
the true purpose of the tutorial. Where efficiency is a potential issue it is often left as an 
exercise for the reader.
<P>
</UL>The programs and resource files used in this tutorial are also provided in electronic form. You can find them in $GALAXYHOME/src/tutorial. Although you should follow the directions in the chapter to build the resource files in order to become familiar with the Visual Resource Builder, there is no need to type in the programs. Each chapter identifies the file name of the programs and resource files it uses.<P>
<A NAME="171"><H1> Conventions</H1></A>
You may have noticed in the previous paragraphs that some words were in a different font than the normal text. The tutorial uses the following conventions:<P>
<UL><LI>Filenames are in the <TT>Courier</TT> font.
<LI>Code samples are in the <TT>Courier</TT> font. 
<LI>Galaxy symbols appearing in normal text are written in <TT><B>bold Courier</B></TT>.
<LI>Commands for you to enter are in Courier and are either <TT><B>bold</B></TT> or <EM>italic</EM>. Text in bold should be entered exactly as written. The text in italics are variables you should enter; substitute the appropriate value for your system.
<LI>User interface items, such as menus and buttons, appear in a <EM><B>bold</B></EM> font.
<LI>The notation <EM><B>menu/item</B></EM> or <EM><B>menu/item/sub-item</B></EM> specifies which menu item to select. For example, select <EM><B>Connection/Show</B></EM> from the dialog editor's menu bar.
</UL><UL><B><I>Note:</I></B> Before you start this tutorial, Galaxy must be installed on your system. If Galaxy has not 
been installed, please refer to the <EM>Galaxy Application Environment Installation Guide</EM> and/or ask 
your system administrator for assistance.
