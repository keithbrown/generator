<A NAME="3204"></A>
The <EM><B>File System Manager</B></EM> is a portable hierarchical file system interface based on a set of device-independent structures. The File System Manager provides services for buffered and raw file I/O, path management, directory management, setting and getting access privileges, and obtaining information about the file system. The File System Manager is designed to address all of the I/O requirements of a typical application. It is not intended, however, as the foundation for complex database engines or for pure transaction processing. The File System Manager provides an API interface that is similar to the I/O primitives provided by most operating systems. If you are familiar with the file system functionality of one or more operating systems, the File System Manager should be simple to understand and use.<P>
<A NAME="4138"><H2> Path Notation</H2></A>
The File System Manager documentation uses the UNIX convention for path notation to describe pathnames consisting of directories and files. The path notation for the root volume is a slash "<TT>/</TT>" character, as is the character used to separate path components. For example, "<TT>/dir/dir1/filename</TT>" describes a path with "<TT>filename</TT>" contained in the directory "<TT>dir1</TT>," which is contained in the directory "<TT>dir</TT>" which is contained in the root directory "<TT>/</TT>". (DOS/Windows uses a similar notation except it replaces the slash with a backslash "<TT></TT>" character.) Full pathnames always begin with a slash to indicate that they start from the root volume. A relative path is any path that does not begin with a slash character. The parent directory of a file or directory is indicated with the symbol "<TT>..</TT>", so<br>"<TT>../filename</TT>" would describe a path to the file "<TT>filename</TT>" contained in the parent directory. The current directory containing a file or directory is denoted by the symbol "<TT>.</TT>", so "<TT>./filename</TT>" would describe a path to the file "<TT>filename</TT>" contained in the current directory. (This is, of course, equivalent to simply using "<TT>filename</TT>" as the path.)<P>
<A NAME="4141"><H2> Glossary</H2></A>
The following is a list of terms important to understanding this document:<P>
<UL><EM><B>Path</B></EM>	A <EM><B>path</B></EM> describes the hierarchical route to a file or directory 
residing anywhere in the global file system name space. 
Paths are identified by type, which can be either a full path 
(starting at the root directory), a relative path (relative to 
another directory), or simply a name. Under DOS/
Windows and the Macintosh, a path may include 
information concerning the volume upon which it resides.
<P><EM><B>Full Path</B></EM>	A <EM><B>full path</B></EM> describes the hierarchical route to a file or 
directory starting from the root of the file system 
hierarchy. Under UNIX the root directory is represented by 
a leading "<TT>/</TT>" character, under DOS/Windows it is denoted 
by "<TT></TT>". A full path in this reference guide always starts with 
the "<TT>/</TT>" character (for example, "<TT>/dir/filename</TT>" is a full 
path, "<TT>dir/filename</TT>" is not.)
<P><EM><B>Relative Path</B></EM>	A <EM><B>relative path</B></EM> describes the hierarchical route to a file or 
directory that explicitly starts from another directory. To 
correctly access a relative path, the File System Manager 
must know the starting directory from which to resolve 
the relative path to its proper location. Relative paths may 
be valid from any number of starting directories, for 
example "<TT>dir/filename</TT>" is valid from any directory that 
contains the directory "<TT>dir</TT>" with a file "<TT>filename</TT>" in it.
<P><EM><B>Canonical Path</B></EM>	A <EM><B>canonical path</B></EM> is a full or relative path that does not 
contain references to current or parent directories that can 
be resolved by the information contained within the path. 
For instance, the path "<TT>/bin/..</TT>" is not canonical because 
it contains the relative reference to the parent directory 
"<TT>..</TT>" and the actual parent directory "bin." The canonical 
version of this path is "<TT>/</TT>". A full pathname can always be 
fully canonicalized because all parent and current 
directory references can be resolved. (Note that the root of 
the directory hierarchy always has itself as a parent 
directory so even "<TT>/../../../../..</TT>" refers to "<TT>/</TT>".) A 
relative path can also be canonicalized to the point where 
only parent directory references that cannot be resolved 
will remain. For instance, the canonical form of the 
relative path "<TT>../dir/..</TT>" is "<TT>..</TT>". Use 
<TT><B>MakePathCanonical</B></TT> to canonicalize paths.
<P><EM><B>Path Leaf</B></EM>	A <EM><B>path leaf</B></EM> refers to the last member of a path that forms 
the ultimate target for File System Manager I/O functions 
that take path arguments. For example, for the path "<TT>/
dir/dir1/dir2/filename</TT>," the path leaf is 
"<TT>filename</TT>." Use <TT><B>SetPathLeaf</B></TT> to change the path leaf 
for a given path.
<P><EM><B>File</B></EM>	A <EM><B>file</B></EM> is defined by the File System Manager as any file 
system object referenced by name that is not a directory or 
folder. Under some operating systems (for example, UNIX) 
files can represent more than bytes on a disk. They can be 
communications portals (sockets, named pipes, and so 
on), or device driver references used to perform I/O 
directly with devices and system resources. These types of 
files are recognized as "special" by the File System 
Manager; however, you can open and manipulate these 
files as you do any other.
<P><EM><B>Directory</B></EM>	A <EM><B>directory</B></EM> is a file system object that serves as a container 
for other directories and files. A directory is also referred to 
as a <EM><B>folder</B></EM>.
<P><EM><B>Folder</B></EM>	Same as a directory.
<P><EM><B>Directory File</B></EM>	A special file used by operating systems to physically store 
directory contents. A directory file contains the names of 
files and directories held in the directory and is almost 
always a read-only object. As a general rule, only the 
operating system itself is ever able to write into directory 
files.
<P><EM><B>Directory Entry</B></EM>	A record within a directory file that contains the name 
(and sometimes other information used by the operating 
system) of a file or directory that is within the directory.
<P><EM><B>Working Directory</B></EM>	The directory in which the current program or process 
resides. When a Galaxy program is running, it will always 
have a working directory associated with it. Working 
directories are important for file system operations and I/O 
operations that use relative pathnames or just file/directory 
names since a relative path or name will be relative to the 
working directory. For example, if a Galaxy program's 
working directory is "<TT>/user/files</TT>," creating the file with 
the path "<TT>file.tst</TT>" will place the file in the "<TT>/user/
files</TT>" directory. (Use <TT><B>CreateFile</B></TT> to create a file.) The 
working directory for a Galaxy application can be changed 
using the <TT><B>SetWorkingDir</B></TT> function or the <TT><B>PushDir</B></TT> and 
<TT><B>PopDir</B></TT> functions. Until it is explicitly changed, the 
application's working directory will be the same as the 
directory from which it was invoked.
<P><EM><B>Current Directory</B></EM>	For a running Galaxy program, the same as Working 
Directory. In pathnames, the current directory is 
referenced by the symbol "<TT>.</TT>".
<P><EM><B>Parent Directory</B></EM>	Refers to the directory containing the referenced file or 
directory&#175;for example, "<TT>bin</TT>" is the parent directory of "<TT>/
bin/demo</TT>." In pathnames the parent directory is 
referenced by the symbol "<TT>..</TT>". (Note that the root of the 
directory hierarchy always has itself as a parent directory 
so even "<TT>/../../../../..</TT>" refers to "<TT>/</TT>".)
<P><EM><B>Symbolic Link</B></EM>	A file system object that serves as a pointer to another file 
or directory. Since it is not a "hard" link (a physical 
reference to a file or directory), a symbolic link can 
reference files and directories that reside on other volumes 
including network volumes. Generally, symbolic links are 
special files that contain the path of the file to which they 
are linked. On operating systems that do not support 
symbolic links, calls to File System Manager functions that 
create and manipulate symbolic links generate the 
exception vexModuleUnimplementedException.
<P><EM><B>Alias</B></EM>	Same as a symbolic link.
<P><EM><B>Invalid Link</B></EM>	A link that points to an object that does not exist or is not 
accessible. For example, when the object pointed to by a 
symbolic link is removed, the symbolic link is not removed 
and will now reference a nonexistent object. It is also 
possible for a symbolic link to be invalid when the file or 
directory to which it points resides on an unmounted 
volume or file system. (For example, a symbolic link could 
point to a file or directory on a floppy disk that has been 
temporarily ejected.)
<P><EM><B>Buffered I/O</B></EM>	Read and write operations that are initially placed in 
input/output memory buffers by the File System Manager 
before actually being read from or written to the target file. 
Using buffered I/O allows the File System Manager to 
optimize access to physical devices. For example, if your 
application is writing small objects to a disk file using 
several write operations, it is very inefficient to perform a 
physical write to the disk (especially a floppy) for every 
object. The operating system has a minimum physical disk 
block size&#175;generally in the 512 to 1024 byte range&#175;that 
it writes out every time a physical write is attempted. In 
the above case, the File System Manager collects the results 
of several successive write operations and only flushes 
them to disk when the buffer is full. The buffer size 
corresponds to the operating system's optimal I/O buffer 
size as defined by <TT>vfsIO_BUFFER_SIZE</TT>.<br>
You may use raw file I/O to bypass the File System 
Manager's buffered I/O if you need to directly access 
physical devices. In most cases this is not necessary, 
because you can flush the buffered contents of any file 
controlled by the File System Manager with the 
<TT><B>FlushFileBuffer</B></TT> function.
<P><EM><B>Raw I/O</B></EM>	Read and write operations that are immediately written to 
the target device. Raw I/O is efficient when reading and 
writing in the operating system's optimal buffer size as 
defined by <TT>vfsIO_BUFFER_SIZE</TT>. Otherwise, it is much 
better to use the File System Manager's default buffered I/
O. Note that even raw I/O does not guarantee real-time 
access to the target device on many operating systems. 
Sophisticated multi-process environments like UNIX 
maintain a buffer cache of disk blocks for performance 
reasons that are the initial targets of read and write 
operations. The operating system decides when to flush 
these buffers. Other operating systems allow "RAM disks" 
that serve as high-speed buffers between the Galaxy 
application and the ultimate target device.
<P><EM><B>Advisory Lock</B></EM>	A lock placed on a file or any portion of a file that has no 
effect on any other program's ability to update it but can 
be detected by other programs. Advisory file locks are used 
by cooperating processes to maintain file consistency. Before 
a process writes to a section of a file, it tests to see if it is 
locked; if it is, it generally waits a short period of time and 
tries again. Cooperative use of advisory file locking allows 
multiple programs to simultaneously access a single file.
<P><EM><B>Volume</B></EM>	A <EM><B>volume</B></EM> generally refers to a secondary storage device like 
a hard disk, floppy, or CD-ROM drive. It can also address a 
network connection that represents a remote file system 
on another machine. Under UNIX, volumes are not 
generally used by the File System Manager, because 
separate physical devices and disk partitions are usually 
connected to present a single contiguous file system 
hierarchy.
<P><EM><B>File System</B></EM>	Same as a volume. (Under UNIX, a file system is usually 
associated with a volume that represents a physical disk or 
portion of a disk, or a remotely mounted network volume.)
<P><EM><B>File Channel</B></EM>	Sometimes referred to as a <EM><B>file descriptor</B></EM> or a <EM><B>file handle</B></EM>, a 
<EM><B>file channel</B></EM> is the internal reference used by the operating 
system to access to an open file. All operating systems limit 
the number of file channels available to Galaxy client 
programs, therefore limiting the number of simultaneously 
open files. The File System Manager's file caching 
mechanism is designed to overcome this problem. There are 
also several functions provided to allow client programs 
with special I/O needs to manage file channels directly (for 
example, <TT><B>ReserveFileChannels</B></TT>, 
<TT><B>SurrenderFileChannels</B></TT>.)
<P></UL><A NAME="4209"><H2> General Purpose Constants</H2></A>
The File System Manager defines a number of constants that are used by various functions for special purposes. (For example, the function <TT><B>Access </B></TT>uses several constants to determine which access privileges to test.) Special purpose constants are defined in the documentation for each of the functions that use them. The following are globally defined constants that are used by the File System Manager:<P>
<UL><TT>vfsMAXIMUM_NAME_LEN</TT>	Indicates the maximum number of bytes in a file name 
that the operating system will allow. UNIX supports 
maximum file name lengths from 14 characters (System V 
3.x) to 255 characters (BSD, SunOS, System V 4.x). DOS/
Windows currently supports a special file naming 
convention that allows file names of up to eight characters 
with an optional extension of three bytes (referred to as 
the "8.3" convention). The File System Manager allows up 
to eleven bytes for a DOS/Windows file name if it does not 
include a period extension separator. The first eight bytes 
are used for the file name and any remaining bytes are 
automatically used as the extension. If a period extension 
separator is included in the file name under DOS/
Windows, the File System Manager enforces the standard 
8.3 convention. If possible, you should choose file names 
that conform to the lowest common denominator 8.3 
DOS/Windows convention. UNIX and MacOS support any 
DOS file name as a natural subset of their file system 
capabilities.
<P><TT>vfsMAXIMUM_PATH_LEN</TT>	Indicates the maximum number of bytes in a pathname 
(including path separators) that the operating system will 
allow.
<P><TT>vfsIO_BUFFER_SIZE</TT>	Indicates the operating system's optimal buffer size for I/O. 
Usually corresponds to the operating system's default disk 
block size or the size of individual buffers in the buffer 
cache.
<P><TT>vfsNO_VOLUME_REFERENCE</TT>	Indicates that a particular volume has no volume reference 
ID. (Used when getting or setting a volume reference ID 
number for a particular file system or volume.)
<P><TT>vfsSURRENDER_ALL_CHANNELS</TT>	Used by <TT><B>SurrenderFileChannels</B></TT> as an argument to 
indicate that all file channels currently reserved by the 
Galaxy client program for special use are now free to be 
used by the File System Manager.
<P><TT>vfsNO_FILE</TT>	Defines a NULL value for <TT>vfsFile</TT> pointers. Provided for 
convenience.
<P></UL><A NAME="4237"><H2> How the File System Manager Works</H2></A>
The File System Manager provides an abstraction layer above the basic file system primitives of the native operating system. As with other Galaxy managers, the File System Manager is meant to be completely functional and does not represent the lowest common denominator of the underlying services it replaces. In some cases, such as file locking or multi-user access privileges, abstractions are only available on operating systems that support them.<P>
The File System Manager manages file system resources in conjunction with the underlying operating system's physical limits. In one very important case&#175;the limit on the number of simultaneously open files&#175;it provides an internal caching mechanism to allow the Galaxy developer to open a virtually unlimited number of files. This mechanism transparently closes files and caches the information needed to reopen them in their previous state when too many files are opened. When an I/O operation is requested for a file in the cache, it is reopened transparently and the requested I/O is performed. In reality, most applications will never open enough files for the caching mechanism to come into play.<P>
<A NAME="3358"><H2>  Key Functionality</H2></A>
When you are using the File System Manager, you must first initialize it via a call to <TT><B>vprefSetArgs</B></TT>. This automatically calls <TT><B>Initialize</B></TT> and sets up the File System Manager environment. You must make sure this is done before you open any files or change the application's working directory.<P>
In general, blindly mixing File System Manager calls with native system calls that manipulate the file system is a bad idea. The File System Manager maintains state information about the files and volumes it is managing that can be invalidated by using native operating system facilities. Defined entry points within the File System Manager provide you with explicit access to C library I/O functions and OS system calls if you need to access them.<P>
The File System Manager supports advisory file locking on operating systems that support it. Advisory locks have no effect on file I/O, so you are always able to read and write to sections of a file that have been locked by other threads/processes. Advisory locks require cooperation among threads/processes competing for the file. Each thread or process must test a file or file section for locks before writing to it. The following code fragment is an example:<P>
<A NAME="4261"><I>Example 73.  Testing a file for locks
</I><P>
<PRE><UL>   vfsFile *file;

   vbyte *buf;

   if (vfsIsFileRangeLocked(file, vfsGetFilePos(file),
                            vfsIO_BUFFER_SIZE)) {
      /*
       * Possibly display an error message,
       * wait and try again, etc.
       */
   } else
     vfsWriteFile(buf, sizeof(vbyte), vfsIO_BUFFER_SIZE, file);

</UL></PRE>You may lock more than one section of a file at any given time. However, the operating system will generally have an absolute limit on the number of locks that can be placed on a single file.<P>
On systems that support overlapping locked regions in a file, locks created by the same process can be overlapped to produce a single contiguous lock region. Locking two contiguous regions will have the same effect. Likewise, unlocking portions of an existing lock region will "fragment" it and create multiple locks. Note that you cannot create overlapping locks or unlock regions locked by another process.<P>
<A HREF="File_System.html#5315">Figure 35</A> graphically illustrates what will happen to a 400 byte file through a sequence of four file locking/unlocking operations carried out by a single process. The locked regions are shaded.<P>
<A NAME="5315"><I>Figure 35.  File locking/unlocking sequence
</I><P>
<IMG SRC="File_System.anc.gif"><P>
When testing for the presence of locks using <TT><B>IsFileLocked</B></TT> or <TT><B>IsFileRangeLocked</B></TT>, if any portion of the section to be tested is locked, these functions return <TT>TRUE</TT>. The File System Manager constant <TT>vfsLOCK_TO_END</TT> is supported by <TT><B>LockFileRange</B></TT>, <TT><B>UnlockFileRange</B></TT>, and <TT><B>IsFileRangeLocked</B></TT> to indicate lock/unlock/test to the end of the file. Files locked using <TT>vfsLOCK_TO_END</TT> always lock to the end of the file's contents even if new data is appended to the file.<P>
<UL><B><I>NOTE:</I></B> File System Manager file locking supports the Network Lock Manager and 
allows file locking for remote Network File System (NFS) files. In practice, 
many operating systems do a poor job implementing the NFS lock daemon 
and can "hang" a Galaxy client program that attempts to lock files across 
NFS. Be careful to test the implementation of the platforms you wish to 
target.
<P>
</UL>For operating systems that have special file sharing modes or "deny bits," the Galaxy default is to allow sharing for both reading and writing. This was done to ensure backward compatibility with earlier versions of Galaxy, among other things. To turn off one or the other or both, <TT>OR</TT> in the following flags to the <TT>accessType</TT> parameter of <TT><B>OpenFile</B></TT>.<P>
<UL><TT>vfsOPEN_DENY_READ	</TT>Open a file disallowing read access by others.
<P><TT>vfsOPEN_DENY_WRITE</TT>	Open a file disallowing write access by others.
<P><TT>vfsOPEN_DENY_READ_WRITE</TT>	Allow neither read nor write by others.
<P></UL>For example, to open a file for reading and writing by the person opening the file, but allow others to open the file for reading only while the first person has the file open, use the following call.<P>
<PRE><UL>   vfsOpenFile(existingFile,
               vfsOPEN_READ_WRITE | vfsOPEN_DENY_WRITE);

</UL></PRE>As a final note, when using the File System Manager, you must interact with the Galaxy String Manager to import file, directory, and volume names. Several examples included in this document illustrate how to do this with various File System Manager functions. As with the rest of Galaxy, you should not assume you are dealing with a single character set or your application will be less portable and more difficult to internationalize.<P>
<A NAME="4423"><H2> Sample Code</H2></A>
Complete source code demonstrating some of the concepts presented in this chapter is available in your Galaxy distribution in the <TT>samples/docsamps</TT> directory.<P>
The <TT>file_system</TT> example illustrates how to use the File System Manager. It is by no means intended to provide an exhaustive view of the API; however, it should give you a good idea of how to make your Galaxy application interact with the file system in a portable manner.<P>
