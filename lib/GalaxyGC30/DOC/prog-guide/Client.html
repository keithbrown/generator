<A NAME="3843"></A>
The <EM><B>Client</B></EM> class is responsible for implementing the low-level functionality required by a multi-client, single-process environment. It is used extensively by the Application class to coordinate the use of global state by multiple clients. In fact, the Client and Application classes can be viewed as two parts of the same module, providing low-level and high-level services respectively.<P>
The Client class requires very few services of its own, so it is available to practically all of the Galaxy libraries. The Application class, in contrast, is available only to those modules at the window system layer and above.<P>
The Client class allocates blocks of per-client global data on behalf of those modules that require it and maintains a set of master pointers through which client-specific globals can be accessed for the active client. Additionally, the Client class maintains a list of shutdown procedures that are called immediately before client termination and another list whose procedures are called immediately before process termination.<P>
The Client class is used primarily by libraries that need to maintain distinct global state for each active client. An application (a program with a <TT>main</TT> function) will find the Client class useful only if it creates multiple client objects either directly or indirectly through the Application class. It is recommended that you use the Application class interfaces for this purpose, since it provides additional functionality. <P>
Like the Application class, the Client class programmatic interface is identical for both kernel-based and distributed environments.<P>
<A NAME="4019"><H2>  Key Functionality</H2></A>
A typical application will not refer to the Client class at all. Applications should perform any necessary shutdown tasks prior to returning from main instead of using <TT><B>RegisterShutdown</B></TT> or <TT><B>RegisterGlobalShutdown</B></TT>.<P>
A library that needs to manage global state should call the Client class to allocate its module and register its shutdown procedures when it is referenced for the first time. A typical Galaxy library determines whether or not it needs to start-up based on the contents of the master pointer provided by the Client class. <P>
The Client class comes configured to allocate space for all the Galaxy libraries, plus a large number of user libraries. It is possible that this limit could be exhausted by an excessive number of user libraries. If this happens, a call to <TT><B>SetModuleMax</B></TT> can increase the amount of per-client master pointers allocated. This call should be made before any libraries are referenced, because the master pointer block cannot be expanded once it is allocated:<P>
<PRE><UL>int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
   vclientSetModuleMax(200); /* call before any other libraries */
   vstartup(argc, argv);
   //...
}

</UL></PRE><A NAME="4009"><H2> Sample Code</H2></A>
Complete source code for demonstrating some of the concepts presented in this chapter is available in your Galaxy distribution in the <TT>samples/docsamps/client</TT>.c file. <P>
