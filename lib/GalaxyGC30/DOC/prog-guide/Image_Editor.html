The <EM><B>image editor</B></EM> provides a common interface to the user for creating images. The image editor comes with a complete set of tools and choosers for drawing images, selecting fonts and colors, and importing and exporting images in various formats. Image formats supported by the image editor are:<P>
<DL>
<DT><DD> GIF                     PBM
<DT><DD> XBM                   ICO
<DT><DD> PGM                   DIB
<DT><DD> PPM                   BMP
<DT><DD> <IMG SRC="Image_Editor.anc.gif">
</DL>
The image editor can be created and used in any Galaxy application and is the recommended method for creating and editing images.<P>
<A NAME="3295"><H2> Component Overview</H2></A>
<A HREF="Image_Editor.html#3301">Figure 42</A> shows an image editor containing a galaxy. The components of the image editor are described on the following pages.<P>
