The <EM><B>Control</B></EM> class (<TT>vcontrol</TT>) provides a framework for implementing dialog items that have a "value." Controls are typically used to portray discrete document or application attributes. A control has a visible state which reflects its <EM><B>value</B></EM>. For example, the value of a scroll bar varies with the position of its thumb, the value of a toggle is 0 or 1 depending on whether or not the toggle is highlighted, and the value of an option menu is the index of the menu item shown. The user can manipulate a control in order to change its value. For example, the user can drag a scroll bar thumb, click a toggle, or select an item from an option menu. Controls also have <EM><B>minimum</B></EM> and <EM><B>maximum</B></EM> values that specify the range over which the control value can be set.<P>
Controls have a number of other attributes that determine how the control responds to the user. The control's <EM><B>view</B></EM> attribute determines its indicator length relative to the size of the control. For example, the view setting allows a scroll bar to change its thumb size based on the size of the pane to which it is attached relative to the size of the area it is scrolling over. <EM><B>Increment</B></EM> and <EM><B>page</B></EM> attributes determine how much the value of a control changes in response to certain user manipulations. For example, the increment attribute determines how much to add or subtract from the value when the user clicks a scroll bar's down or up arrows, and the page attribute determines how much to add or subtract when the user clicks a scroll bar's page regions.<P>
The Control class is basically an abstract class. Subclasses of the Control class provide useful kinds of controls that can be incorporated directly into application dialogs. <P>
<UL><LI>A <EM><B>toggle</B></EM> is a two-state switch that can be either on (value one) or off (value zero). Toggles can be exclusive or non-exclusive. An <EM><B>exclusive</B></EM> toggle means that only one toggle in a given group can be selected at a time; a <EM><B>non-exclusive</B></EM> toggle has no such restriction. A "check box" is a non-exclusive toggle; a "radio button" is an exclusive toggle. A <EM><B>tri-state toggle</B></EM> is a toggle that can have a third value (minus one) in addition to the on and off values. Tri-state toggles are useful when a third state needs to be represented in an application. 
<LI>An <EM><B>option menu</B></EM> is a control with an attached menu; the value of the option menu is the index of one of the items in the menu. The selected menu item is drawn inside the option menu when the option menu is not activated. 
<LI>A <EM><B>slider</B></EM> lets the user drag over a linear range of values.
<LI>A <EM><B>scroll bar</B></EM> is a slider subclass with increment arrows that allow the scroll bar value to be changed by fixed amounts.
</UL>All control classes are subclasses of the default dialog item class. This means that you can treat a control as a dialog item by calling a Dialog Manager dialog item entry point with the pointer returned by <TT><B>GetItem</B></TT>.<P>
The Control class also provides an <EM><B>Alternate Style</B></EM> attribute which permits a control to have a second appearance. Two controls currently make use of this attribute: OPEN LOOK check boxes and sliders. OPEN LOOK check boxes are normally drawn as a setting (a rectangular box with a title inside). If the alternate style attribute is on the check box will be drawn with a box which is highlighted with a check mark over the box and its title to the right of this check box. OPEN LOOK sliders are drawn with tick marks when alternate style is active. The spacing of the tick marks is determined by the <EM><B>Page</B></EM> attribute of sliders. All other controls are not affected by the alternate style attribute.<P>
