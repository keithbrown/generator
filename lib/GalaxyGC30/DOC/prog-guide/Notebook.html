<A NAME="3204"></A>
The <EM><B>Notebook</B></EM> classes provide facilities for creating and manipulating notebooks. Notebooks are dialog items that organize and present information to a user so the user can find, display, and edit the information quickly and easily. Notebooks are often used in dialogs that implement preferences or other user settings.<P>
A notebook resembles a physical notebook in appearance and performance. It contains one or more pages each of which contains dialog items that the user can view or edit. Only one page (the active page) is visible at a time. The remaining pages are "stacked" behind the active page.<P>
Pages in a notebook can be grouped into sections. A section in a notebook is similar to a page, except its contents are pages or other sections. The contents of a section are only visible when the user steps to that section.<P>
Each page and section has an associated tab which can be graphically displayed with the notebook. The tab, which corresponds to an index tab in a physical notebook, allows the user to "step" to pages that are not currently visible.<P>
By using pages and sections to group related items, large amounts of data can be presented to the user in a simple framework that does not sacrifice screen real estate. For example, the Visual Resource Builder (<TT>vre</TT>) uses notebooks to implement resource editors. The dialog editor in <TT>vre</TT> contains three pages; each page represents a set of related features. <A HREF="Notebook.html#5515">Figure 61</A> shows each of the three pages from the dialog editor.<P>

<A NAME="5517"><H2> Glossary</H2></A>
The following terminology is used throughout this document when discussing notebooks.<P>
<UL><EM><B>Active or Current Selection</B></EM>	The page (or section) of a notebook that is currently 
visible. Also referred to as the active page.
<P><EM><B>Folio</B></EM>	Status line for a notebook that displays the total number of 
pages in a notebook and the page number of the active 
page.
<P><EM><B>Major Tab Set</B></EM>	Manages the major tabs of a notebook.
<P><EM><B>Major Tabs</B></EM>	Tabs drawn for top-level pages and sections in a notebook.
<P><EM><B>Minor Tab Set</B></EM>	Manages the minor tabs of a notebook.
<P><EM><B>Minor Tabs</B></EM>	Tabs drawn for second level pages or sections in a 
notebook. If a section is at the top level of a notebook tree, 
and is the active selection (is visible), then tabs are drawn 
for each page and section contained within the section.
<P><EM><B>Notebook</B></EM>	Dialog item that presents information to a user in a series 
of pages and sections. Pages and sections can optionally 
display tabs which allow quick access to the page or 
section.<br>
Notebook items are modeled after physical notebooks.
<P><EM><B>Notebook Class</B></EM>	Subclass of a section that can hold sections or pages. A 
notebook item is an instance of this class.
<P><EM><B>Notebook Tree</B></EM>	Hierarchical representation of an instance of a notebook. 
A notebook is always at the root of the tree. Sections are 
organizational branches to pages or other sections in the 
tree. Pages are the leaves of the tree.
<P><EM><B>Page</B></EM>	Unit of information displayed by a notebook and is 
comparable to a sheet from a physical notebook. A page is 
a subclass of container and can hold any number of dialog 
items. Pages are typically used to present information to a 
user that the user can view or edit.<br>
Pages are always leaves on a notebook tree.
<P><EM><B>Page Buttons</B></EM>	Buttons displayed with a notebook that allow the user to 
step forward or backward through the pages of a notebook.
<P><EM><B>Section</B></EM>	Subclass of a page that holds pages or other sections. Each 
section contains a current selection which is the last page 
(or section) visited by the user.<br>
Sections allow you to group related information in a 
hierarchical format.
<P><EM><B>Style</B></EM>	Series of attributes that controls the appearance and 
behavior of a notebook. The defaults are set by the default 
laf in the notebook's class but can be overridden per 
instance.
<P><EM><B>Tab</B></EM>	Visible extension to a page or section that allows the user 
direct access to that page or section. Tabs for a notebook 
are contained in tab sets.
<P><EM><B>Tab Set</B></EM>	Holds, displays, and manages a collection of tabs. The 
current state and selection of the notebook is reflected in 
the tab set. A major and minor tab set is automatically 
created, if necessary, with each notebook.
<P></UL><A NAME="5572"><H2> Notebook Tree</H2></A>
A notebook is built upon a tree structure of sections and pages.<P>
Pages are always leaves of the tree while sections provide organizational branches to leaves or other sections. Note that a section is a special type of page that holds pages or other sections. The root of the tree is the notebook, which is a special case of section.<P>
A current selection is the last page (or section) visited by the user in a section. Each section contains information designating its current selection. When the user steps through a notebook, the Notebook class uses an in-order tree traversal algorithm to locate the current selection for each step. <A HREF="Notebook.html#5584">Figure 62</A> illustrates the hierarchy of a typical notebook tree.<P>
<IMG SRC="Notebook.anc1.gif"><P>
<A NAME="5584"><I>Figure 62.  Notebook tree
</I><P>
<A NAME="5586"><H2> Pages</H2></A>
A page represents the information presented on one sheet from a physical notebook. A page is a subclass of container and holds any number of dialog items. Typically, the dialog items represent settings that a user can view or edit. Each page contains a tab which is owned by the notebook. The class for a page contains methods that allow the page to be manipulated by the notebook or section that owns it.<P>
<A NAME="5871"><H2> Sections</H2></A>
A section provides a way to group and organize information in a notebook. A section is a subclass of a page but can only contain pages and other sections. Since sections can contain other sections, information can be organized into a hierarchical format.<P>
<A NAME="5874"><H2> Notebook</H2></A>
A notebook is a subclass of section and inherits from the section and page class that it is built upon. A notebook is at the root of a notebook tree and contains all the pages and sections in the tree.<P>
A notebook manages the major and minor tab sets, page buttons, and an optional style.<P>
<A NAME="5878"><H2> Tabs</H2></A>
Each page and section of a notebook has an associated tab which provides the user access to the page or section. The page or section that a tab represents owns the tab and is responsible for destroying it. Tabs are managed and displayed by tab sets. Refer to the section "Tab Sets" for more information on tab sets.<P>
Tabs are subclassed from dialog item and inherit all the attributes of a dialog item. Each class of tab contains additional methods to calculate and draw its border and contents. This way you can easily subclass to create a tab that is different than the default.<P>
<A NAME="5883"><H2> Tab Sets</H2></A>
Tabs belong to a tab set which is responsible for managing and displaying the tabs. The tab set can be any type of dialog item that can reference the tabs. For example, if a tab set is represented as a list item, then the names for each tab is contained in the list. When the user selects a name from the list, the page corresponding to that tab is displayed in the notebook. Option menus and containers are examples of other dialog items you can use to represent a tab set.<P>
By overriding the notebook member functions for creating and managing a tab set, there are many different ways that a notebook can be graphically represented. The notebook class provides only one representation, a tab set based on a container that displays tabs similar to an actual tab on a file folder. <A HREF="Notebook.html#5903">Figure 63</A> and <A HREF="Notebook.html#5909">Figure 64</A> show two alternative ways to implement a tab set. <A HREF="Notebook.html#5903">Figure 63</A> shows a list item implementation&#175;a selection from the list at the left corresponds to the page displayed at the right. <A HREF="Notebook.html#5909">Figure 64</A> uses an option menu to select the page to be displayed.<P>
<IMG SRC="Notebook.anc2.gif"><P>

<A NAME="5909"><I>Figure 64.  Tab set implemented with an option menu
</I><P>
<A NAME="5911"><H3> Major and Minor Tab Sets</H3></A>
A tab set is either a major or minor tab set. A major tab set contains all the tabs for pages and sections at the top level of a notebook. A minor tab set contains tabs for pages or sections at the second level of a notebook. (The pages and sections contained within a top level section are at the second level of a notebook.) A minor tab set is displayed only when the section it represents is visible.<P>
Each notebook can contain a major and minor tab set.<P>
<A NAME="5915"><H2> Notebook Styles</H2></A>
Various attributes of a notebook control its behavior and appearance. These attributes are determined from notebook styles. The <TT>vnotebook</TT> class contains a style that is the look-and-feel default for a given look-and-feel. To override one or more of these defaults, a style is installed on the notebook instance. If a style is not present or a style setting is not specified in the notebook's instance, it is retrieved from the class-level style of the notebook.<P>

attributes.
<P></UL><A NAME="5945"><H3> Visual Representation</H3></A>
The appearance and visual orientation of a notebook is largely determined by the tab sets and binding. Usually, a notebook resembles a note pad or book with a three dimensional look. A pad or book is held together by a binding on one side and optionally contains tabs along another side (usually the side opposite the binding). The tabs allow you to quickly access to a particular page or section in the notebook.<P>
The notebook object is similar to this actual physical model; however, there are two levels of tabs, major and minor. The placement of the major and minor tab sets determine the orientation of the notebook. The binding is always placed opposite the side of the major tab set. The minor tab set is placed on either of the adjacent sides.<P>
To make a notebook appear more three-dimensional, you can specify the number of pages visible from the edge of the pad or book that the notebook represents. The page count attribute of a style defines the number of virtual pages shown, and the page step attribute defines the distance between each virtual page.<P>
The contents of a tab along the vertical side of a notebook (vertical tab) are normally drawn horizontally. A problem inherent with drawing vertical tabs horizontally is the amount of screen real estate it takes to represent them. You can specify an attribute for a vertical tab that defines whether the tab contents should be drawn horizontally or rotated ninety degrees.<P>
<A NAME="3358"><H2>  Key Functionality</H2></A>
The next three sections follow the class hierarchy of notebooks and discuss pages, sections, and notebooks. (Notebooks are subclassed from sections, which in turn are subclassed from pages.) Next is a discussion on tabs and tab sets, followed by a section on notebook styles.<P>
<A NAME="5557"><H2> Creating a Notebook</H2></A>
To create a standard notebook, call <TT><B>Create</B></TT>. Use<TT><B></B></TT> <TT><B>AppendSectionPage</B></TT> to append pages or sections to the notebook. The order of the pages and sections in a notebook determine the order that pages in a notebook are traversed. Use<TT><B></B></TT> <TT><B>GetPageIndex</B></TT> to determine the order (index) of a page. To change the index of a page, and thus the order, use <TT><B>SetPageIndex</B></TT>.<P>
Use <TT><B>CreatePage</B></TT> and <TT><B>AppendPage</B></TT> to create pages and add them to a notebook. You can also use <TT><B>AppendSectionPage</B></TT> to add pages to a section.The Visual Resource Builder provides facilities to create and edit pages which can be stored in a resource file. To read a page from a resource file, use <TT><B>LoadPage</B></TT>. For more information on using the Visual Resource Builder, refer to Visual Resource Builder User's Guide.<P>
To retrieve the container that a page is based on use <TT><B>GetPageContainer</B></TT>. Any of the container API entry points can be used to perform operations on the container such as append, delete, or change the index of dialog items. Refer to the Container chapter for more information on the container entry points.<P>
<A NAME="5601"><H3> Page Methods</H3></A>
The following methods for pages are commonly used in notebooks.<P>
<UL><TT>vnotebookPAGE_IS_VALID
</TT><P>	Returns <TT>TRUE</TT> if a page is in a valid state so that we can 
change to another page.
<P><TT>vnotebookSELECT_PAGE
</TT><P>	This method is called when a page is selected as the current 
page in the notebook.
<P><TT>vnotebookUNSELECT_PAGE
</TT><P>	This method is called when a page is no longer selected as 
the current page in the notebook.
<P><TT>vnotebookCREATE_PAGE_TAB
</TT><P>	This method is called when you create a new tab for a page. 
This method allows you to have your own subclass of tab.
<P></UL>Use <TT><B>CreateSection</B></TT> to create a section. To add a section to a notebook or section, you must first retrieve the page from the section with <TT><B>GetSectionPage</B></TT>. Then use either <TT><B>AppendPage</B></TT> or <TT><B>AppendSectionPage</B></TT> to append it to a notebook or section.<P>
Each section keeps track of its current selection. The current selection is the section or page that was last visited by the user. When a user steps to a section the current selection becomes active. If the current selection is a page, then the page is displayed. If the current selection is itself a section, then the Notebook class gets the current selection for this section.The current selection is the currently visible section or page.<P>
<TT><B>GetSectionCurrentPage</B></TT> returns the currently active page or section. You can test whether a section or page is returned by this function with <TT><B>IsSection</B></TT>. If you have a notebook and you just want to get the actual page that is in current use, call <TT><B>DetermineCurrentPage</B></TT>. <TT><B>DetermineCurrentPage</B></TT> calls <TT><B>GetSectionCurrentPage</B></TT> until a page is returned, as illustrated in <A HREF="Notebook.html#5653">Example 110</A>.<P>
<UL><B><I>NOTE:</I></B> Most entry points like <TT><B>SetSectionCurrentPage</B></TT> or <TT><B>AppendSectionPage</B></TT> 
take a page as the parameter. Since a section is a type of page, you can 
retrieve the page from the section with <TT><B>GetSectionPage</B></TT>. Use this function 
to pass a section into any function that takes a page as a parameter.
<P>

}

</UL></PRE>You can set the title of a tab with <TT><B>SetTabTitle.</B></TT> If the title of a tab is not specified, the title is taken from the title of the dialog item that the page is based on.<P>
A tab can optionally have an image associated with it. There are a series of <TT><B>SetTabImage*</B></TT> functions you can use to add, remove, or modify the behavior of the image associated with a tab. An image does not have to be explicitly set for each tab for a tab to have an image associated with it. The image can be derived from a parent tab by traversing the notebook tree. For example, if we set the image for a section's tab, each page's tab under the section would use the image from its parent section's tab (unless an image was explicitly set for the page's tab). If you do not want a tab to derive an image, call <TT><B>SetTabImageNone</B></TT> with <TT>TRUE</TT>.<P>
You can set the font for a tab by calling <TT><B>vdialogSetItemFont</B></TT> on a <TT>vnotebookTab</TT> item. If you do not specify a font the default font is used. The font for a tab can also be inherited from a tab's parent object in the same way that an image can be inherited.<P>
Tab sets are created when the tab style is set with <TT><B>SetStyleTabs</B></TT>. The tab sets are owned by the notebook and are destroyed when the notebook is destroyed. After setting the tab style with <TT><B>SetStyleTabs</B></TT>, add the style to the notebook with <TT><B>SetStyle</B></TT>.<P>
The Notebook class provides four options for tab set styles which are listed in <A HREF="Notebook.html#5828">Table 30</A>. Pass the indicated constant to <TT><B>SetStyleTabs</B></TT> to specify a tab set style. <A HREF="Notebook.html#5767">Example 112</A> shows how to specify both major and minor tab sets for a notebook.<P>

If you want to have a tab visible for each page in a notebook you do not need to use sections. Specify <TT>vnotebookTABS_PAGE</TT> for notebooks that contain only pages. However, if you want to have both major and minor tabs, your notebook must contain sections. Specify <TT>vnotebookTABS_MAJOR_AND_MINOR</TT> to display tabs on the first and second level.<P>
Specifying <TT>vnotebookTABS_PAGE</TT> with notebooks that are more than one level deep essentially flattens out the hierarchy of the notebook&#175;tabs for all pages are visible. In this case, the Notebook class uses an in-order traversal of the notebook tree to determine the order of tabs displayed.<P>
<A NAME="5837"><H3> Overriding Default Styles</H3></A>
Styles in a notebook control much of its appearance and behavior. The class of a notebook contains a style that defines the default values, If you want to change one or more of the settings from the default, a style is installed on the notebook instance with the new settings defined. For example:<P>
<PRE><UL>   style2 = vnotebookCreateStyle();
   vnotebookSetStyleFolio( style2, FALSE );
