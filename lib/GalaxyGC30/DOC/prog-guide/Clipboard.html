The <EM><B>Clipboard</B></EM> class provides a portable application programming interface to the clipboard mechanism available in the end-user environment and in the creation of internal clipboards (for example, the cut buffer in GNU-Emacs) for application use. Clipboards are implemented asynchronously in order to work properly in environments where a "paste" operation involves communication with other applications via a remote server (for example, the X window system).<P>
A Galaxy <EM><B>Global Clipboard</B></EM> object provides a portable interface to the clipboard mechanism provided by the end-user environment. Applications typically access Global Clipboard contents with commands like "Cut," "Copy," and "Paste." Refer to end-user environment-specific documentation for the particular interface conventions. Examples of Global Clipboards include the clipboard provided by the Microsoft Windows environment, the Apple Macintosh environment, and the clipboard transfer mechanism specified by the ICCCM for the X Window System. The global clipboard class is not an exported class.<P>
<UL><B><I>NOTE:</I></B> All Global Clipboard objects share contents. Changing the contents on a 
particular instance changes the contents on all instances.
<P>
</UL>A Galaxy <EM><B>Selection Clipboard</B></EM> object provides a portable interface to the Primary Selection Transfer (or Quick Transfer) mechanism available in the end-user environment. The contents of the Selection Clipboard are usually the last text or data selected in any application on the user's display. Primary Selection Transfer is most often associated with the X Window System, but Galaxy supports it on all platforms. The selection clipboard class is not an exported class.<P>
<UL><B><I>NOTE:</I></B> All Selection Clipboard objects share contents. Changing the contents on a 
particular instance changes the contents on all instances.
<P>
</UL>A Galaxy <EM><B>Default Clipboard</B></EM> class  serves as a building block for the Global and Selection Clipboards. The default clipboard can be used as the basis for application specific clipboards and cut buffers (for example, the cut buffer in GNU-Emacs).<P>
The Clipboard class depends on the Window class to initialize the default classes for both Global and Selection Clipboards. Attempts to to use clipboards before they are initialized cause a /Module/Startup exception.<P>
<A NAME="3358"><H2>  Key Functionality</H2></A>
The Clipboard class is limited to using only text in its current form. In a future release of Galaxy it will be expanded to handle more than just text. Currently, the Clipboard class is documented largely because it is used internally by the Galaxy libraries to implement cut, copy and paste functionality and selection transfer to varying degrees depending on platform. You should rarely need to use the current Clipboard class directly.<P>
Use <TT><B>Create</B></TT> or <TT><B>Init</B></TT> to create or initialize a clipboard of the default class. Use <TT><B>CreateSelection</B></TT> or <TT><B>CreateGlobal</B></TT> to create a clipboard to interface with the window system selection or clipboard mechanism.<P>
<TT></TT>The Selection Clipboard contents are always set to the value of the last selection (in an application that supports Primary Selection Transfer). The Global Clipboard contains data that is "copied" or "cut" from applications that support clipboard transfer.<P>
Multiple instances of selection and global clipboards are valid. This allows multiple data values and notify functions to be specified. However, the contents of every instance of selection and global clipboards are "shared." Setting the contents on one instance changes the contents on all instances (even those in other applications).<P>
The contents of each instance of a default clipboard are not affected by operations on any other clipboard.<P>
A notify function must be specified before the contents of a clipboard can be retrieved. If a notify function is not specified, the request function generates an <TT>/Arg</TT> exception.<P>
<TT><B></B></TT>The Clipboard class passes a pointer to the clipboard and a pointer to a copy of the clipboard contents to only: the notify function. The application becomes the owner of the copy of the clipboard contents and is responsible for destroying it.<P>
