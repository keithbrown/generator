The Drawing classes provide a consistent and powerful rendering abstraction based on the PostScript imaging model. The Drawing classes also encapsulate platform-specific graphics systems, such as Macintosh QuickDraw, X11 Xlib, or the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI), to provide functions that an application uses to generate graphical output for displays, printers, and other raster-graphics hardware devices.<P>
The Drawing classes insulate you from the details of the actual hardware device used for rendering, letting you deal with an idealized environment. The Drawing classes take care of translating rendering directives from this idealized space to the actual hardware device environment. The use of an idealized rendering environment allows for the creation of device-independent graphics. Thus a single rendering algorithm can be expressed on a variety of output devices, including bitmap displays, printers, and off-screen images.<P>

<P></UL><A NAME="3627"><H3> Drawing Path</H3></A>
One method of rendering is accomplished by constructing a path (<TT>vdrawpath</TT>) of line and curve segments, then either drawing (outlining) it or filling it with color. In a path composed of disconnected segments, each disconnected part of the path is known as a subpath. Paths are created by a series of path construction functions, the most basic of which are described below.<P>
The Drawing rendering model uses the concept of a set of connected points (a path) in a two-dimensional coordinate space. The location of the origin is arbitrary and is defined to be whatever is most convenient. Usually the origin is defined as the lower, left-hand corner of a page, meaning that a positive x and y pair describes each point on the page. Note that this coordinate system model is different from those used by many other graphics system where the origin is usually defined as the upper, left-hand corner of the display device.<P>
For efficiency as well as convenience, the drawing context class (<TT>vdrawcontext</TT>) provides fill and draw operations to construct and render rectangular paths. When rendering on a window or image device, these functions are likely to be more efficient than creating rectangular paths with path construction functions. To specify a rectangular region, the drawing context class uses the rectangle class (<TT>vrect</TT>).<P>
The Drawing classes also use the transform class (<TT>vtransform</TT>) to transform page description information from one coordinate space to another. The three types of transformations that can be accomplished are translation, rotation, and scaling.<P>
Most standard drawing functions accept double and integer values as arguments.<P>
<A NAME="3633"><H3> Drawing Context</H3></A>
A drawing context (<TT>vdrawcontext</TT>) contains information such as the current drawing location and the pen used for drawing. A pen (<TT>vdrawpen</TT>), in turn, contains attributes such as the color and line width. The drawing context uses these attributes to directly fill or draw lines, rectangles, arcs, strings and other drawing objects. A drawing context also can fill in or draw a specific drawing path.<P>
Drawing operations can be directed at different kinds of devices. The device attribute of a drawing context specifies the device on which a painting function leaves marks, and is called the current drawing device. Galaxy provides device drivers for windows, images, and PostScript printers.<P>
<A NAME="3636"><H3> User Space And Device Space</H3></A>
The drawing context class maintains two parallel coordinate systems for drawing operations: user space and device space. In the user-space coordinate system, a drawing is specified as an ideal, device-independent, picture description, often expressed in points. In the device-space coordinate system, a drawing is specified in terms of actual device pixels. The drawing context class maps user-space coordinates to device-space coordinates according to the current transformation matrix specified in the drawing context.<P>
<A NAME="3638"><I>Figure 29.  User space and device space
</I><P>
<IMG SRC="Drawing.anc1.gif"><P>
The user-space origin is located in the lower left corner of the device, with coordinate values increasing up and to the right. User-space units are initialized to one point (1/72 inch). The scale and orientation of the coordinate system, however, can be changed through the drawing context class. Functional interfaces for the most common display transformations, such as rotation and scaling, are provided so explicit scaling and rotating computations are generally not necessary.<P>
<A NAME="3640"><H3> Image and Character Space</H3></A>
The drawing classes use another kind of coordinate system, image space, for image operations. When images are brought into Galaxy, the drawing imposes a known rectangular coordinate system on the image data. The purpose of the image space coordinate system is to structure the source image so that it can be mapped to user space, and from there to device space. The Drawing class uses the image matrix to perform the transformation from image space to user space. Once mapped to user space, the image can be drawn onto the target device using the drawing context's transformation matrix.<P>
<A NAME="3642"><I>Figure 30.  Image transformations
</I><P>
<IMG SRC="Drawing.anc2.gif"><P>
The drawing classes uses another similar coordinate system, called character space, to specify character shapes. Font class methods transform these shapes to user-space and subsequently to device-space. Refer to the Font chapter for information on how to specify, create, and modify fonts.<P>
<A NAME="3644"><H3> Clipping Paths</H3></A>
The drawing context class provides two clipping regions: the view clipping path and the user clipping path. Pixels must lie inside both clipping paths to be painted by drawing operations; pixels outside either of the two paths are unaffected by drawing. For example, trying to draw outside of an application's known windows is not possible, since the view clipping path extends only to windows that belong to your application.<P>
<A NAME="3646"><I>Figure 31.  Clipping paths
</I><P>
<IMG SRC="Drawing.anc3.gif"><P>
Whenever portions of the window need to be redrawn, the window class sets the view clipping path. For this reason, you should not modify the view clipping path while updating is taking place. Some devices ignore the view clipping path, so it is important that you not depend on the view clipping path for your drawing.<P>
You can set the user clipping path to specify the region to be rendered as required by your drawing. The user clipping path is stored on a per-drawing-context basis.<P>
<A NAME="3358"><H2>  Key Functionality</H2></A>
Most drawing operations take place in four steps:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Get the current drawing context.
<BR>
</OL>
<UL>Most drawing routines provide a drawing context for you. For example, a dialog item's draw method looks like the following:<P>
<PRE><UL>void myDraw (vdrawcontext *context)
{
   // Do your drawing here.
}

</UL></PRE>Sometimes, though, it is necessary to create a drawing context. As a result, most graphical objects provide a <TT>CreateDrawcontext</TT> method. For example, the following creates a drawing context from a dialog item:<P>
<PRE><UL>{
   vdrawcontext *context;
   vdialogItem  *diSomething;

   //...
   context = vdialogCreateItemDrawcontext(diSomething);
   // Now use the context to draw on the dialog item
   //...
}

</UL></PRE>This ensures that all drawing takes place on an isolated graphics state and does not interfere with or overwrite other drawing actions that might be performed.<P>
</UL><OL>
<LI>Modify the drawing context's attributes.
<BR>
</OL>
<UL>Before drawing, it is sometimes necessary to modify the attributes of the drawing context. If the drawing context is passed in as an argument to a method from the calling method, do not modify it. Instead, clone it and modify the clone. Modifying a drawing context passed as an argument to a method can cause unpredictable behavior later in the program's execution. If the drawing context was created in the method with <TT>vdialogItemCreateDrawcontext</TT> or another method that returns a drawing context, it is not necessary to clone it before changing its attributes.<P>
Many attributes are set by modifying the context's pen. Retrieve the current pen by using <TT>GetPen</TT>. The pen can then be used to set various drawing attributes. To specify the color when drawing or filling, use <TT>SetColor</TT>. For information on defining colors and color specifications, refer to the Color chapter.<P>
Use <TT>SetLineWidth</TT> to specify the pixel width of lines. The default width is one pixel, although this can be set to be a higher value as needed. You can also use <TT>SetLineCapStyle</TT>, <TT>SetLineJoinStyle</TT>, and <TT>SetLineJoinMiterLimit</TT> to control the style of line drawing you may want to perform.<P>
When drawing text, specify the font for the text with <TT>SetFont</TT>. For information on fonts, refer to the Font chapter.<P>
All drawing is done from a point of origin (where both the x offset and the y offset are equal to zero). The default point of origin for a drawing context is the lower left hand corner of the current device coordinate system (for example, a dialog or container). Use <TT>Translate</TT> to change the point of origin to some other location. <A HREF="Drawing.html#3697">Example 45</A> changes the point of origin from the current location to the lower left hand corner of a dialog item.<P>
</UL><A NAME="3697"><I>Example 45.  Changing the point of origin

<PRE><UL>void ChangeOriginToItem (vdrawcontext *context, vdialogItem *item)

</OL>
<UL>One method of drawing is done by creating a path (<TT>vdrawpath</TT>), and then stroking or filling the path. To create a path, you can use several different functions, some of which are illustrated in <A HREF="Drawing.html#3721">Example 46</A>.<P>

This is convenient since each point on the page can be described by a positive x and y pair. This coordinate system, however, is different from those used by many other graphics system where the origin is usually defined as the upper left-hand corner of the display device.<P>
Whenever portions of the window need to be redrawn, the window class sets the view clipping path. For this reason, you should not modify the view clipping path while updating is taking place, such as in an overridden method that controls the drawing of updated regions.<P>
Do not depend on the view clipping path, since some devices ignore the view clipping path.<P>
