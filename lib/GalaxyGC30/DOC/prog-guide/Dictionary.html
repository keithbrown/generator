<A NAME="3204"></A>
The <EM><B>Dictionary </B></EM>class maintains associations between arbitrary pairs of objects. A pointer or scalar value can be stored in a dictionary as the <EM><B>value</B></EM> of another pointer, called its <EM><B>key</B></EM>. The value can be quickly recovered from the dictionary through the key. Each distinct key must have a distinct address, because the values of the pointers are compared to determine equality. The Name class is useful for obtaining key pointers to character strings. Each dictionary has a <EM><B>hash function</B></EM>, that is used to distribute its keys into a hash table. Dictionaries are commonly used to bind names to various kinds of objects such as commands, classes, and generic attributes.<P>
Dictionary key pointers are typically obtained from the Name class methods <TT><B>vnameInternGlobal</B></TT> and <TT><B>vnameIntern</B></TT>. These functions return pointers to name objects for character strings. A name in this sense is a pointer to a character string that is unique based on the contents of the string. The Name class returns the same string pointer for each string with the same contents&#175;name pointers can thus be compared as if they were atomic values. You do not need to compare the characters of a name with the characters of another name to determine equality.<P>
Every name pointer is unique within the context of a single name table; you will typically use the global name table to store your names. The global name table is provided as a convenience by the Name class for applications that do not wish to manage their own names. You will want to manage your own names only if you create a large number of names that can be destroyed once your application is finished with them (a language compiler is an example of this kind of application). Virtually all Galaxy modules with functions that have name arguments expect global names. Refer to the Name chapter for more detailed information about names.<P>
Galaxy dictionaries are modeled on dictionary objects in the PostScript language, though different verbs are used by the Galaxy Dictionary class. The Galaxy dictionary type also corresponds to the IdentityDictionary class in the Smalltalk language and the finite function type included in many functional programming languages.<P>
<A NAME="3358"><H2> Key Functionality</H2></A>
Note that the Dictionary class uses the verbs <TT><B>Load</B></TT> and <TT><B>Store</B></TT> to read and write dictionary keys and values, not to read and write dictionary resources. This usage is inconsistent with the use of <TT><B>Load</B></TT> and <TT><B>Store</B></TT> in other parts of the Galaxy API.<P>
<A NAME="3978"><H2> Sample Code</H2></A>
Complete source code demonstrating some of the concepts presented in this chapter is available in your Galaxy distribution in the <TT>samples/docsamps</TT> directory.<P>
The program listing in <TT>dictionary</TT> contains sample code to help you get started using the Dictionary class in an application. Rather than exploiting all of the features of the Dictionary class, this sample demonstrates the use of the common routines you will most likely need to use the Dictionary class.<P>
The sample program allows a user to store key/value string pairs in a dictionary and query its contents. It uses the Name class's global name table to obtain unique pointers to character strings. This program uses the C stdio libraries since its purpose is to demonstrate use of the Dictionary and Name classes, not user interface components. The command-line syntax is <TT>&lt;</TT>key<TT>&gt;=&lt;</TT>value<TT>&gt;</TT> to store and <TT>&lt;</TT>key<TT>&gt;</TT> to load. The contents of the dictionary can be dumped with "<TT>?</TT>". The program exits on "<TT>!</TT>".<P>
