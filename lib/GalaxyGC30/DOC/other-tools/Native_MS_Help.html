<H2>Using the MSWindows Help System from Galaxy</H2>

The Microsoft Help System has a different model from Galaxy's. This causes some 
caveats and differences in behavior. The full feature set of Windows Help is not 
supported, only the features which map into the Galaxy API, <CODE>HELP_CONTEXT</CODE> (help on 
a context) and <CODE>HELP_PARTIALKEY</CODE> (help on a concept).

<H3>Concepts</H3>
Due to the way Windows works, asking for help on a concept will always succeed. 
If the concept is the leading substring of a keyword in the help file, Windows 
will bring up a chooser with the first keyword containing that leading substring. 
For example, help on the concept "c" would yield the chooser with the first "c" 
keyword, unless of course there was a concept "c." If there are no leading 
substrings, then the first element in the chooser is selected.

<H3>Contexts</H3>
Windows uses integer IDs for the contexts. The Galaxy Help Manager uses strings. 
To map between these, the application resource must contain a resource called 
<CODE>vhelpMSWindowsMap</CODE> which contains an array "<CODE>ContextStrings</CODE>" of strings and an 
array "<CODE>ContextIDs</CODE>" of integers. The arrays must be of the same length, where
each index in one array pairs with the corresponding index in the other array 
to map strings into integers. When the application request help on a context,
help is displayed if there is an entry in the map, otherwise the request fails.
<CODE>vhelpSwitchToNestedContext</CODE> is implemented in the client rather than on the 
server; it keeps trying until it succeeds or runs out of options.

<H3>vmswhlpt.exe</H3>
To facilitate the creation of this mapping, Galaxy for Windows includes a utility called 
<CODE>vmswhlpt</CODE> (the Visix Microsoft Windows Help Tool) in the <CODE>%GALAXYHOME%\BIN</CODE> directory. It has 
the following syntax:<BR>
<UL>
<TT>vmswhlpt [-h] [-o output-file] file*</TT>
</UL>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD><TT>-h file*</TT></TD><TD>C header files (default is not).</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><TT>-o output-file</TT></TD><TD>The resource file to use. If the file exists, it will replace the resource file; otherwise it will create it. The default is out.vr.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><TT>file*</TT></TD><TD>Input files containing only empty lines, or lines mapping a string to an integer. </TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
If the <CODE>-h</CODE> option is used, the file is expected to only contain "<CODE>#define symbol value</CODE>" 
definitions, where symbol is the Galaxy help context string and value is the integer 
Windows help ID. The default is a plain file containing lines of the form "symbol value." 
The file will often be a file <CODE>#include</CODE>d from the <CODE>[MAP]</CODE> section of the project file that 
the Windows help compiler uses.

<H3>Notification</H3>
Windows does not notify the application when the window closes, thus the 
<CODE>vhelpEventCLOSED_WINDOW</CODE> event is never sent to a vhelpWindow. Switching a concept or 
context will notify with either <CODE>vhelpEventOPENED_WINDOW</CODE> or <CODE>vhelpEventREQUEST_FAILED</CODE>.

<H3>Quitting</H3>
Quitting the application sends the Windows <CODE>HELP_QUIT</CODE> message to the server. This 
means that if your application is the only one using the server, you will lose the 
help window when the application quits. This should not be a problem in normal GUI 
applications.

<H3>.hlp Files</H3>
The Windows help calls ask for the <CODE>.hlp</CODE> file. The Help Manager assumes that this 
file is in the application directory, and that it is named application-name<CODE>.hlp</CODE>. 
To change the application name, use <CODE>vhelpSetApplicationName</CODE>. The Windows help calls 
also ask for the window that the help request came from. The Galaxy API does not 
have this concept because help requests do not have anything to do with windows at 
all, so the Help Manager maintains a private hidden window for this.

<H2>Help Manager API for Native Help</H2>

<TT>void vhelpUseNativeHelpSystem(void)</TT>
<UL>
Will use the native help system for a platform, where the native system is 
supported. Where the native system is not supported (or does not exist) this is 
equivalent to <CODE>vhelpUseGalaxyHelpSystem</CODE>.
<P>
This call can currently be made at any time during an application execution, 
even after using help from another system.
</UL>
<P>

<TT>void vhelpUseGalaxyHelpSystem(void)</TT>
<UL>
Will use the Galaxy help system (as opposed to the native help system). Unless 
otherwise noted, this is the default.
<P>
This call can currently be made at any time during an application execution, 
even after using help from another system.
</UL>
<P>

<TT>void vhelpUseMSWindowsHelpSystem(void)</TT>
<UL>
Will use the Microsoft Windows help system (as opposed to the Galaxy help system). 
Generates <CODE>vexModuleUnimplemented</CODE> if not available, such as on a non-Windows platform. 
This is the equivalent to <CODE>vhelpUseNativeWindowsHelpSystem</CODE> when on a Windows platform.
</UL>
<P>

<TT>int vhelpMSWWindowsHelpSystemIsAvailable(void)</TT>
<UL>
Returns <CODE>TRUE</CODE> if <CODE>vhelpUseMSWindowsHelpSystem</CODE> will succeed.
</UL>
<P>

<H2>Making a Galaxy-built Windows Application "Windows Help Ready"</H2>

The following procedure describes the standard method to make a Galaxy Windows 
application help-ready. An example is provided in the DRAWRES sample located 
in the <CODE>\GALAXY\SAMPLES\DRAW</CODE> directory.
<P>
Add the following line after you call <CODE>vstartup</CODE>:<BR>
<UL>
<TT>vhelpUseNativeHelpSystem();</TT>
</UL>
<P>
In the future, selection of a help system may be made via a start-up preference, 
but for this release you must explicitly ask for the native help system in code.
<P>
Note that currently on a system other than MS Windows, this will still use the Galaxy help system.
<P>
Generate your help text with any tool that generates RTF (Microsoft Word, for example).
<P>
In your help project (<CODE>.hpj</CODE>) file, make sure the <CODE>MAP</CODE> section includes a map file and does 
not embed the context map directly.
<P>
Use vmswhlpt to construct a map dictionary using the map file. Use the following syntax:<BR>
<UL>
<TT>vmswhlpt mapfile -o resourcefile</TT>
</UL>
<P>
If your map file is <CODE>myapp.map</CODE> and you want the output in <CODE>myapp.vr</CODE>:<BR>
<UL>
<TT>vmswhlpt myapp.map -o myapp.vr</TT>
</UL>
<P>
A dictionary called <CODE>vhelpMSWindowsMap</CODE> will be added to the resource file. Note that 
<CODE>vmswhlpt</CODE> is a windows program and should be executed using the Run menu item in 
Program Manager or File Manager. Any output produced by the program will be located 
in <CODE>VDEBUG.LOG</CODE>.
<P>
Use <CODE>hcw</CODE> to generate your <CODE>.hlp</CODE> file. This file must be located in the same directory
as the executable.
<P>
We have included a sample which illustrates using the native Windows Help System. 
The <CODE>drawres</CODE> program has been modified to use the Windows help system using the 
procedure described above.
<P>
The file <CODE>vdrawres.rtf</CODE> contains the help source; the help project file is <CODE>vdrawres.hpj</CODE>; 
and the map file is <CODE>vdrawres.map</CODE>.
<P>
To produce the help file, use the command <CODE>hcw drawres.hp</CODE>. This will start the 
Microsoft Help Workshop. Choose the Save and Compile button from the main dialog. 
This produces <CODE>vdrawres.hlp</CODE>.
<P>
The <CODE>vmswhlpt</CODE> program has already been run. If you look at <CODE>drawres.vr</CODE> using the 
Visual Resource Builder, you will see the <CODE>vhelpWindowsMap</CODE> dictionary has already 
been created.
<P>
