<A NAME="2660"></A>
The language used to represent Galaxy resource files in ASCII was designed to keep the representation small, to allow some human reading and editing, and to permit exact recreation of a resource file.<P>
This language is tailored to the primitives of Galaxy resource files and provides a different type of token or collection syntax for each resource type. The tokens are separated by white space; the amount and nature of the white space does not matter as far as the reader is concerned. The backslash (<TT></TT>) is an escape character that marks non-delimiting delimiters, non-graphic ASCII characters, and non-ASCII characters. The following sections describe the various token and collection syntax types for each resource type.<P>
<A NAME="2663"><H1> Tag</H1></A>
A token for a tag starts with a colon (<TT>:</TT>) and ends with unescaped white space of any kind. Internal spaces are represented by a backslash preceding a space (<TT> </TT>). Internal newlines are represented by <TT>n</TT>. Internal backslashes are represented by <TT></TT>. All other non-graphic ASCII characters are represented by <TT>PQR</TT>, where P, Q, and R are octal digits and PQR is equal to the ASCII value of the character. Characters with more than 7 bits of significance are represented by <TT>xSTUV</TT>, where S, T, U, and V are hexadecimal digits and STUV is equal to the 16-bit value of the character.<P>
Examples:<P>
<PRE><UL>:Class
:abcde fghnijkx5DEDlmn177opq
</UL></PRE><A NAME="2668"><H1> Integer</H1></A>
A token for an integer starts with a plus (<TT>+</TT>) or a minus (<TT>-</TT>) and ends with white space of any kind. The value is represented by a string of decimal digits. An integer may have up to 32 bits of significance.<P>
Examples:<P>
<PRE><UL>+0
+1234
-12
</UL></PRE><A NAME="2674"><H1> Fixed</H1></A>
A token for a fixed point number starts with a percent sign (<TT>%</TT>) and ends with white space of any kind. The value is represented by integral parts and fractional parts separated by pluses (<TT>+</TT>) and minuses (<TT>-</TT>). Each fractional part is further divided by a slash (<TT>/</TT>) into a numerator and a denominator. The denominator can have any value, but strictly it should be one of 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 65536. (In the future a more compact representation may be considered.)<P>
Examples:<P>
<PRE><UL>%0
%1234
%1/2
%1+1/128
%-1-3/4
%65535/65536
</UL></PRE><A NAME="2683"><H1> Float</H1></A>
A token for a floating point number starts with an asterisk (<TT>*</TT>) and ends with white space of any kind. The value is represented by a normal C-style floating point token, with or without a decimal point and with or without an exponential part.<P>
Examples:<P>
<PRE><UL>*0
*1234.567
*1.2e-12
</UL></PRE><A NAME="2689"><H1> String</H1></A>
A token for a string starts with a double quote (<TT>"</TT>) and ends with an unescaped double quote (<TT>"</TT>). Internal newlines are represented by <TT>n</TT>. Internal backslashes are represented by <TT></TT>. All other non-graphic ASCII characters are represented by <TT>PQR</TT>, where P, Q, and R are octal digits and PQR is equal to the ASCII value of the character. Characters with more than 7 bits of significance are represented by <TT>xSTUV</TT>, where S, T, U, and V are hexadecimal digits and STUV is equal to the<br>16-bit value of the character.<P>
A number of conventions are used to allow long strings to wrap in a way that allows them to be correctly unwrapped. A single space surrounded by two non-spaces can be replaced with an unescaped newline. All other white space, including multiple spaces, can be followed by an unescaped newline that is not considered a substitute for a single space. An escaped newline, <TT></TT> followed by a newline (not <TT>n</TT>), may split any two characters.<P>
Examples:<P>
<PRE><UL>"Foo"
"The next newline is really a space.<br>
Internal newlines must be represented as an escaped `n'.n<br>
Other escaped sequences can be used, like ", , 077,<br>
and xABCD.n
A newline will be translated into a single space unless it<br>
is escaped, or preceded by other white-space or escaped seq<br>
uences representing white-space.n"
</UL></PRE><A NAME="2696"><H1> Boolean</H1></A>
There are only two tokens for booleans. An ampersand (<TT>&amp;</TT>) followed by a zero (<TT>0</TT>) stands for FALSE. An ampersand followed by a one (<TT>1</TT>) stands for TRUE.<P>
Examples:<P>
<PRE><UL>&amp;0
&amp;1
</UL></PRE><A NAME="2701"><H1> Character</H1></A>
A token for a single character starts with a single quote (<TT>'</TT>) and ends with white space of any kind. If the character after the quote character is not a backslash (<TT></TT>), then that character is the value. Otherwise, newlines are represented by <TT>n</TT>. Backslashes are represented by <TT></TT>. All other non-graphic ASCII characters are represented by <TT>PQR</TT>, where P, Q, and R are octal digits and PQR is equal to the ASCII value of the character. Characters with more than 7 bits of significance are represented by <TT>xSTUV</TT>, where S, T, U, and V are hexadecimal digits and STUV is equal to the 16-bit value of the character.<P>
Examples:<P>
<PRE><UL>'a
'$
'n
'000
'277
'x0000
'xFFFF
</UL></PRE><A NAME="2711"><H1> Opaque</H1></A>
There are two representations for opaque data. The first starts with a tilde (<TT>~</TT>) and uses uuencoding. The second starts with a single front quote (<TT>\Q</TT>) and uses simple hexadecimal encoding. Both forms end with a line that starts with a single front quote. The uuencoding does not have a begin or end statement, but otherwise can be cut-and-pasted to or from an actual uuencoded file. The hexadecimal encoding may have extraneous white space between pairs of hexadecimal digits, but not within the pairs.<P>
Examples:<P>
<PRE><UL>~
M@=&gt;!UX'7@=&gt;!UX'7@=&gt;!UX'7@=&gt;!UX'7@=&gt;!UX'7@=&gt;!UX'7@=&gt;!UX'7@=&gt;!

</UL></PRE><A NAME="2724"><H1> Dictionary</H1></A>
A dictionary starts with an open brace (<TT>{</TT>) token and ends with a close brace (<TT>}</TT>) token. Between these tokens there must be an even number of tokens and/or collections, and the first of each pair must be a tag token. The tag is the name used to retrieve the corresponding value (which may also be a tag) from the dictionary resource. An implicit pair of braces surrounds an ASCII resource text file if there is more than one token or collection in the file.<P>
Examples:<P>
<PRE><UL>{ :Name "Fred" :Value +1 }
{ :Tag :Foo :ArrayOfTags [ :aaa :bbb :ccc ] }
</UL></PRE><A NAME="2729"><H1> Array</H1></A>
An array starts with an open hard bracket (<TT>[</TT>) token and ends with a close hard bracket (<TT>]</TT>) token. Between these tokens there may be any number (possibly zero) of tokens or collections, but they must all be the same type.<P>
Examples:<P>
<PRE><UL>[ +12 +34 +18 ]
[ &amp;1 &amp;1 &amp;0 &amp;0 &amp;0 &amp;1 &amp;0 ]
[ { :Name "Wilma" :Value -23 } { :Name "Barney" } ]
</UL></PRE><A NAME="2735"><H1> Untyped</H1></A>
An untyped resource token is a single question mark (<TT>?</TT>). An empty array collection is also untyped.<P>
<A NAME="2737"><H1> Comment</H1></A>
A comment is represented as a token that starts with a pound sign (<TT>#</TT>). It continues to the next newline (escaped or not) and is not used in the transcription process at all. A comment is only used in ASCII resource files and cannot be stored or retrieved from an actual binary resource.<P>
