<A NAME="2740"><H1> Usage</H1></A>
Command line: <TT>vr2vrx [options] RESOURCE_FILE [ASCII_VRX_FILE]</TT><P>
<TT>vr2vrx</TT> writes out an ASCII representation of the Galaxy resource file specified with the pathname RESOURCE_FILE. By default, the entire resource file is transcribed. With the <TT>-dumpstrings</TT> and <TT>-source</TT> options, <TT>vr2vrx</TT> only transcribes part of a resource file.<P>
The ASCII representation can be used with other utilities that work on ASCII files or can be read and edited directly with any text editor. By default, <TT>vr2vrx</TT> generates identical output for functionally identical Galaxy resource files. This is because dictionary tags in a resource file are sorted into a canonical order. An ASCII representation of resource files is useful when using a source code control system.<P>
By default, the ASCII output is placed in the current directory. The name of the output file is the same as RESOURCE_FILE, except any extension is replaced with <TT>.vrx</TT> or <TT>.vrs</TT>. The <TT>.vrs</TT> extension is used when the <TT>-dumpstrings</TT> flag is specified. In either case, you can directly specify an output file and path with the <TT>-vrx</TT> option. If a file already exists with the same name as the output file and the <TT>-force</TT> flag is not used, the program fails.<P>
If the pathname ASCII_VRX_FILE is specified, the ASCII output is placed here. No extension is added on top of the provided name&#175;you must provide any extensions you want. This is an alternate form of the <TT>-vrx</TT> option.<P>
The <TT>-nosort</TT> flag can be used to speed up the transcription when there are dictionaries with many tags and no need to have the dictionary elements in any particular order. However, with this option the output of <TT>vr2vrx</TT> could vary each time it is run, even when using the same resource file.<P>
The<TT> -dumpstrings</TT> option collects all of the string resources from within all or part of the resource file and writes them to the output files as two identical arrays. One array is tagged "OriginalStrings" and the other is tagged "TranslatedStrings." By default, the strings are sorted into a canonical order and duplicates are removed. The <TT>-nounique</TT> flag leaves the duplicates, and the <TT>-nosort</TT> flag, which implies the <TT>-nounique</TT> flag, leaves the strings unsorted.<P>
<A NAME="2749"><H1> Options</H1></A>
<TT>vr2vrx</TT> recognizes the following options (user-supplied variables are indicated in italics).<P>
<DL>
<DT><DD> <TT>-addindent </TT><EM>spacecount</EM> 
<DL>
<DT><DD> Specifies the number of additional spaces with which to start each begin line in 
the output file based on the depth of the resource. Unless <TT>-notabs</TT> is specified, 
every 8 indent spaces is replaced with a tab. However, opaque data and wrapped 
strings always start at the extreme left. 

<DT><DD> By default, spacecount is 8.

</DL>
</DL>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><DD> <TT>-dumpstrings</TT>
<DL>
<DT><DD> Specifies that instead of transcribing the entire resource file or part of it, the 
program dumps out two identical arrays with all of the string resources. The 
arrays are sorted and uniqued unless the <TT>-nosort</TT> and/or <TT>-nounique</TT> flags are 
used.

<DT><DD> These arrays are intended to be used to help translate resource files from one 
natural language to another. The TranslatedStrings array can be modified in 
place by any text editor, and the modified file can be fed into the <TT>vrx2vr</TT> utility 
with the <TT>-translate</TT> option and the original resource file. As long as the 
original resource file and the OriginalStrings array have not been changed, all of 
the string resources in the resource file (or part of the resource file) are translated.

</DL>
</DL>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><DD> <TT>-firstindent </TT><EM>spacecount</EM>
<DL>
<DT><DD> Specifies the number of spaces with which to start each begin line in the output 
file. However, opaque data and wrapped strings always start at the extreme left. 

<DT><DD> By default, spacecount is zero.

</DL>
</DL>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><DD> <TT>-force</TT> 
<DL>
<DT><DD> First removes any file with the same path name as the output file, if one exists. 
Normally, the program fails if a file with that path name already exists.

</DL>
</DL>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><DD> <TT>-help</TT> 
<DL>
<DT><DD> Displays a usage guide. No other action is taken, regardless of any other 
command line arguments. The usage guide is also displayed if no resource file is 
provided or if the <TT>-vr</TT> option (which really belongs to the companion utility 
<TT>vrx2vr</TT>) is used.

</DL>
</DL>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><DD> <TT>-hexopaque</TT>
<DL>
<DT><DD> Specifies that a hexadecimal encoding should be used for opaque resources 
rather than the default uuencoding. The hexadecimal encoding represents 36 
bytes per line versus 45 bytes per line for the uuencoding.

</DL>
</DL>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><DD> <TT>-nosort</TT>
<DL>
<DT><DD> If the <TT>-dumpstrings</TT> option is used, this flag turns off the sorting and uniquing 
of the string resources. If the <TT>-dumpstrings</TT> option is not used, this flag turns 
off the sorting of dictionary tags, which for some resource files can speed up the 
transcription. Note that dictionary tags are sorted first if <TT>-nosort</TT> and <TT>-
dumpstrings</TT> are provided. This guarantees the order of the strings (whether or 
not that order is actually meaningful).

</DL>
</DL>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><DD> <TT>-notabs</TT> 
<DL>
<DT><DD> Specifies that tabs are not to be used in the indents. By default, every 8 indent 
spaces is replaced with a tab.

</DL>
</DL>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><DD> <TT>-nounique</TT>
<DL>
<DT><DD> If the <TT>-dumpstrings</TT> option is used, this flag turns off the uniquing of the string 
resources. This means that a particular string is dumped as many times as it 
appears in the resource file (or part of the resource file).

</DL>
</DL>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><DD> <TT>-shortstring </TT><EM>length</EM><TT> </TT>
<DL>
<DT><DD> Specifies the maximum length of a string (not including quotes) on the indented 
begin line. Strings longer than this length start at the left of a fresh line and wrap 
as needed.

<DT><DD> By default, length is 36.

</DL>
</DL>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><DD> <TT>-source </TT><EM>internalrespath</EM> 
<DL>
<DT><DD> Specifies a subresource within the resource file to write out. Acceptable path 
strings start with a separator character, and that character separates the tags of 
successively deeper dictionary resources and the tag of the ultimate target 
resource. The ultimate resource does not need to be a dictionary resource.

<DT><DD> Elements within an array resource can be selected by an index specifier delimited 
by hard brackets (<TT>[]</TT>) immediately after the tag of the array. If all index specifiers 
in a resource path are single element specifiers, then the ultimate resource is not 
written as an array. If more than one index specifier is a multiple element 
specifier, then one combined array is written. The following are examples of 
valid index specifiers:

<UL>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD> <TT>[]</TT></TD><TD>all elements, in order</TD></TR>
<TR><TD> <TT>[12] </TT></TD><TD>element 12 (the 13th)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD> <TT>[0...] </TT></TD><TD>all elements, in order</TD></TR>
<TR><TD> <TT>[2...] </TT></TD><TD>all elements except the first two, in order</TD></TR>
<TR><TD> <TT>[.] </TT></TD><TD>the last element</TD></TR>

<TR><TD> <TT>[0,12,9] </TT></TD><TD>elements 0, 12, and 9, in that order</TD></TR>
<TR><TD> <TT>[1..5] </TT></TD><TD>elements 1 through 5, inclusive and in order</TD></TR>
<TR><TD> <TT>[5..1] </TT></TD><TD>elements 1 through 5, inclusive and in reverse order</TD></TR>

<TR><TD> <TT>[..2.0] </TT></TD><TD>all even elements, in reverse order</TD></TR>
<TR><TD> <TT>[..2..] </TT></TD><TD>all even or odd elements depending on whether the array's size is, respectively, odd or even, in reverse order</TD></TR>
<TR><TD> <TT>[0,0,9.2.2,0]</TT></TD><TD>element 0 twice, elements 9, 7, 5, 3, and element 0 again</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</UL>
</DL>
</DL>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><DD> <TT>-vrx </TT><EM>asciivrxfile</EM> 
<DL>
<DT><DD> Specifies the output file name and path. No extension is added on top of the 
provided name&#175;you must provide any extensions you want. By convention, 
transcriptions of full or partial resource files have a <TT>.vrx</TT> extension and dumps 
of resource strings have a <TT>.vrs</TT> extension. However, both files are in ASCII and 
use the same language.

</DL>
</DL>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><DD> <TT>-wraplength</TT> length 
<DL>
<DT><DD> Specifies the maximum length of a string (not including quotes) on a single line. 
Strings longer than this length wrap. Wraps that occur on spaces (which is 
attempted first) replace the space with a newline (real newlines are represented 
as <TT>n</TT>) unless the space is immediately preceded by some other white space 
character. Wraps that occur after white space other than a single space character 
just add a newline after the white space. Wraps that occur within a word add an 
escaped newline.

<DT><DD> By default, length is 72.
