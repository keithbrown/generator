<A NAME="395"><H1> Overview of the Galaxy Help Compiler</H1></A>
The Galaxy Help Compiler is a translator and a linker that creates a help document set from help source files. The help compiler uses help project (<TT>.vhp</TT>) files to group help source files into help documents. (Help project files are similar to project files in many popular language compilers.) Help documents are subsequently built into help document sets. Each help document can contain up to 55 help source files.<P>
Help source files can be in either <TT>.hs</TT> or <TT>.rtf</TT> format and are translated into help object (<TT>.vho</TT>) files. Images in Galaxy resource (<TT>.vr</TT>) files can also be used as source files. The object files are linked into help document (<TT>.vhd</TT>) files, which are then built into a help document set (<TT>.vhs</TT>). The help server uses the help document set to provide online help for an application.<P>
<A HREF="Help_Compiler.html#15858">Figure 9</A> shows the components of the Galaxy Help Compiler. <P>

<A NAME="11204"><H1> Starting the Galaxy Help Compiler</H1></A>
You can use the Galaxy Help Compiler in interactive or stand-alone mode.<P>
Interactive mode opens the Help Compiler Window and the Help Project Window. Use these windows to create and build help documents sets.<P>
Stand-alone mode invokes the compiler from the command line without any interactive editors or windows. Stand-alone mode is useful for quickly updating changes to a help project and also allows the project to be incorporated into a makefile for automatic builds. Note that a project must be created in an interactive session before it can be built in stand-alone mode.<P>
<A NAME="10204"><H2> Command Line Options</H2></A>
Command line options should be specified as appropriate for your platform. If no stand-alone options are specified, then the compiler opens in interactive mode.<P>
The command-line for starting the Galaxy Help Compiler is:<P>

</TT></UL></PRE>filename<TT>.vhp...</TT> specifies optional help project files to open for editing. One or more file names can be specified on the command line (the .vhp extension must be included). If no file names are specified, an "empty" Help Project File Window with the name New0.vhp opens.<P>
option represents any of the user-interface or stand-alone options listed in <A HREF="Help_Compiler.html#12523">Table 6</A> and <A HREF="Help_Compiler.html#12456">Table 7</A>.

The Document Information Window contains the following components:<P>
<A NAME="13562"><H3> Document Name</H3></A>
Specifies the title of a help document. When providing online help for your application, the Galaxy Help Server displays the title of a help document in the Table of Contents.<P>
The title can be any literal string, including spaces and special characters. However, if a document file name is not specified, the compiler generates a file name from the document title. The compiler removes spaces and special characters in the title to form a valid file name.<P>
In Visix help syntax, the document title is used to specify an external link to a document.<P>
You should provide unique document names to each document in a document set. This will ensure that any external links to a document are correctly resolved.<P>
<A NAME="13569"><H3> Document File Name</H3></A>
Specifies the file name for a help document, which must be a valid operating system file name. Help document file names end with a <TT>.vhd</TT> extension. If you do not specify the extension, it is automatically added to the specified name.<P>
If you do not specify a file name, the compiler constructs the file name based on the document name. Do not specify a pathname here - the document file is saved using the path to the project file.<P>
<A NAME="13572"><H3> Number of Source Files</H3></A>
Indicates the number of source files in your document. You cannot edit this field.<P>
<A NAME="13574"><H3> Confirm Buttons</H3></A>
Applies editing changes made in the Document Information Window. These buttons may vary, depending on your current look-and-feel.<P>
<A NAME="11171"><H2> Adding Images to a Document</H2></A>
You can add images to a help document using the Galaxy Help Compiler; however, you must first convert any image you add to a Galaxy <TT>vimage</TT>. Use the Visual Resource Builder to convert or create images in this format. The name of an image must match the argument to the <TT>@image</TT> command that references the image in the help syntax source file.<P>
Place your images in a resource file and add this resource file to your document using the procedure for adding source files. The compiler extracts the images from the resource file when creating the help document. The help compiler treats the resource file containing images as a help source file and counts it toward the 55 source file limit.<P>
Galaxy Help Services provides several default images you can use in help documents. You do not need to add default images to a help document. The compiler automatically links any specified default image into the document. <P>
<A HREF="Help_Compiler.html#15924">Figure 15</A> shows a resource file containing images for a help document. The resource file was created with the Visual Resource Builder.<P>
<UL><B><I>NOTE:</I></B> Use any valid operating system file name for the resource file containing 
images, but to avoid name collision do not use names that match the name 
of any help source file. For example, the resource file <TT>images.vr</TT> and the 
help source file <TT>images.hs</TT> are both translated into the object file 
<TT>images.vho</TT>.

<A NAME="12035"><H3> Specifying Images for Different Look-and-Feels</H3></A>
You can specify images to display in a help document according to the look-and-feels available to your users. This is useful if you want to include screen shots or other images that are platform-specific. To include platform-specific images your image resource file needs to have a separate dictionary for each look-and-feel. The resource tag names of the look-and-feel dictionaries are:<P>
<UL><LI><TT>CUA</TT>
<LI><TT>Macintosh</TT>
<LI><TT>Motif</TT>
<LI><TT>Open Look</TT>
<LI><TT>Windows</TT>
<LI><TT>Default</TT>
</UL>Within each look-and-feel dictionary, place the image you want displayed when that look-and-feel is running. Note that the corresponding images in each dictionary must have identical names since they are all being referenced by one <TT>@image</TT> command in the help source file.<P>
Images placed in the <TT>Default</TT> dictionary are displayed under all look-and-feels. If an image is at the top-level of the resource file, it is displayed on all platforms.<P>
<A HREF="Help_Compiler.html#15930">Figure 16</A> shows a resource file specifying platform-specific images for a help document. The image with the tag name "Sample Image" is at the top-level and will be displayed on all platforms. This image could also have been placed in the Default dictionary. The images with the tag name "Laf-specific Image" are all placed in look-and-feel dictionaries. The help server displays the appropriate "Laf-specific Image" image for the platform on which it is running.<P>

<A NAME="11173"><H1> Updating a Help Project</H1></A>
Updating a help project creates a help document set for your help project. The help compiler translates the help source files into help object files, then links the object files into help document files. Finally, the help document files are built into a help document set.<P>
When updating a project, the help compiler checks to see if any help object files are current, and only generates new ones if necessary. A help object file is current if its timestamp (time and date of creation) is more recent than its corresponding source file.<P>
<DL>
<DT><DD> <EM><B>To update a help project:</B></EM>
<OL>
<LI>Select Update Project from the Project Menu in the Help Project Window.

the steps remaining to build your help document set.

<DT><DD> Additionally, the Compiler Status Window opens, displaying errors, warnings, 
or other information according to the current compiler    preferences.

</DL>
</DL>
If the compiler successfully creates an object file for a source file, it places a check next to the source file in the Help Project Window. If the compiler encounters an error and cannot create an object file, it places an "X" next to the source file.<P>

You can force recompilation of a project by deleting the object files and updating the project. You can also force a partial remake by removing only some of the object files before updating the project.<P>
You may want to force recompilation of help projects that were built with a previous version of the compiler. You should also force recompilation whenever the current status of a project is in question.<P>

The Compiling Status Window reports four types of messages:<P>
<UL><LI>Errors
<LI>Warnings
<LI>Information
<LI>Noise
</UL><A NAME="10374"><H3> Errors</H3></A>
The compiler reports errors when either translating or linking failed, and no document set is built. Use the error messages to help find the error and fix it before updating the project again.<P>
<A NAME="10375"><H3> Warnings</H3></A>
When warnings are reported, the document set is built, but it may not perform as expected. Use the warning messages to determine if any remedial action needs to be taken.<P>
<A NAME="10376"><H3> Information</H3></A>
Information messages report details of the translation and linking process. These messages do not indicate a problem with compilation.<P>
<A NAME="10377"><H3> Noise</H3></A>
Noise messages report further details of compilation. As with information messages, noise messages do not indicate a problem with compilation.<P>
<A NAME="10378"><H1> Setting Compiler Preferences</H1></A>
The Galaxy Help Compiler has preferences to specify the level of messages generated when updating a project and for setting the compiling/linking timeslice. Use the Preferences... option from the File Menu to open the Preferences Window. The Preferences Window is displayed in <A HREF="Help_Compiler.html#15964">Figure 20</A>.<P>

<IMG SRC="Help_Compiler.anc11.gif"><P>
<A NAME="10379"><H2> Specifying Display Messages</H2></A>
To specify the level of messages displayed during translating and linking, select the appropriate toggles in the Display Messages section. Refer to <A HREF="Help_Compiler.html#10368">"Types of Messages"</A> for a description of these messages. By default, Errors and Warnings are selected.<P>
When using the compiler in stand-alone mode, you cannot specify the level of displayed messages. In stand-alone mode only errors and warnings are displayed.<P>
<A NAME="10386"><H2> Compiling/Linking Timeslice</H2></A>
The help compiler does internal multitasking, dividing its time between the user interface (UI) and compiling. A faster UI means that compiling is slower, but the UI is more responsive. A slower UI means that compiling is faster, but the UI may take longer to respond to user actions.<P>
To set the compiling timeslice, adjust the slider bar in the Preferences Window.<P>
<A NAME="10389"><H1> Generating Resource Tags</H1></A>
To provide context-sensitive help to an application, you need to reference resource tag names from the application's resource file. The Dump Resource File Tags command prints a text file of all the resource tags in an application's resource file. <P>
<DL>
<DT><DD> <EM><B>To print resource tags for an application's resource file:</B></EM>
<OL>

Note that you can also use the <TT>dumptags</TT> option to the compiler in stand-alone mode to print resource tags for an application's resource file. For details on specifying stand-alone options, refer to the <A HREF="Help_Compiler.html#14462">section "Stand-alone Mode"</A>.<P>
<A NAME="15037"><H1> Compiling Help from a Command Line</H1></A>
Stand-alone mode invokes the compiler from the command line without any interactive editors or windows. It is useful for quickly updating changes to a help project and also allows the project to be incorporated into a makefile for automatic builds.<P>
You cannot specify the level of messages generated by the compiler for stand-alone mode - only error and warning messages are generated. Error and warning messages can be saved to disk on platforms that allow redirection of the output.<P>
The following options are available from stand-alone mode. Refer to <A HREF="Help_Compiler.html#10204">"Command Line Options"</A> for details on specifying stand-alone options.<P>
<A NAME="14175"><H3> compile</H3></A>
The <TT>compile</TT> option creates help object (<TT>.vho</TT>) files from help source files. Any combination of <TT>.hs</TT> or .<TT>rtf</TT> source files can be specified with this option.<P>
<A NAME="14177"><H3> link</H3></A>
The <TT>link</TT> option creates a help document (<TT>.vhd</TT>) file from help object (<TT>.vho</TT>) files.<P>
<A NAME="14179"><H3> build</H3></A>
The <TT>build</TT> option creates a help document set (<TT>.vhs</TT>) file from help document (<TT>.vhd</TT>) files.<P>
<A NAME="14181"><H3> buildDocSet</H3></A>
The <TT>buildDocSet</TT> option creates a help document set (<TT>.vhs</TT>) file from a help project (<TT>.vhp</TT>) file. Use the -<TT>compileAllSources</TT> option with this option to force compilation regardless of the out-of-date status of any object files.<P>
<A NAME="15022"><H3> compileAllSources</H3></A>
The <TT>compileAllSources</TT> option can only be used with the <TT>buildDocSet</TT> option. <TT>compileAllSources</TT> forces compilation regardless of the out-of-date status of any object files.<P>
<A NAME="10390"><H2> Command Line Examples</H2></A>
When building a help document set in stand-alone mode, first compile the source files into help object files. Next, link the object files into help documents. Finally, link the help documents into a help document set. <A HREF="Help_Compiler.html#14154">Example 18</A> illustrates how to build a help document set in stand-alone mode. (This example illustrates command line options for the UNIX platform - be sure to specify options appropriately for your platform.)<P>

</UL></PRE>Note that in <A HREF="Help_Compiler.html#14154">Example 18</A>, you do not need to use a help project to build the help document set. However, you can build a help document set from a help project file in stand-alone mode by specifying the <TT>buildDocSet</TT> option. The help project file must have been previously created in an inter-active session with the compiler. <A HREF="Help_Compiler.html#14163">Example 19</A> illustrates using the <TT>buildDocSet</TT> option.<P>
